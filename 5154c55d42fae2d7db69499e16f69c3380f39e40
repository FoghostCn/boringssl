      "message": "It was suggested by Adam that we should do a rename in case CONSTTIME_DECLASSIFY (and possibly CONSTTIME_SECRET) get another job (namely the DFSan one in the other pull request). I think it makes sense at least if we do this (and I don\u0027t want to forget about it). However, I suggest to figure out what to do with DFSan in general before we make a decision about this.",
