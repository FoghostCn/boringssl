      "message": "Hmm. That does mean we can\u0027t as easily squirrel it behind `OPENSSL_ia32cap_has_bit` and `OPENSSL_get_armcap` functions, but we can always just stick the line in every function, so that\u0027s not that strong of an argument against it.\n\nSince `CRYPTO_library_init` *only* initializes the CPU vector, I think adding extra calls can only help for assembly. I believe this is the list of asm functions that care:\nhttps://paste.googleplex.com/5556261343985664\n\nIt would definitely help with the `aes_hw_*` case. I think the others would still need their own calls though.\n\nThis also precludes us from marking these functions as `const` and allow the compiler to delete duplicate calls. Although it is *slightly* unclear to what extent this is valid:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/6867696/gcc-attributes-for-init-on-first-use-functions\n\nNot that this CL currently achieves it. Looks like we actually need to make an out-of-line function that combines CRYPTO_library_init and reading the value:\nhttps://godbolt.org/z/ohzrxY8e3\n\nI\u0027m slightly tempted to do that though. It\u0027s not uncommon for us to call these in series.
