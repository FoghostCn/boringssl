      "message": "Looks like this test doesn\u0027t actually check that we correctly handle that case. If I comment out resetting `hostname`, the test still passes.\n\nI think we might need an `-expect-no-server-name` flag. (Let me know if you need some pointers here. The flags system is kinda horrible and doesn\u0027t distinguish \"no expectation\" from \"expect empty string\" very well. One of these days, I want to replace the shim \u003c-\u003e runner bit with a JSON thing and then we can just write a struct literal and move on with life.)",
