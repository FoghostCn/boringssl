      "message": "It doesn\u0027t. The cmp_type parameter is the string type expected out of |a|. X.509, in a rare moment of sense, picks particular string types for each of the CHOICE arms in GeneralName. In the SAN path, cmp_type \u003e 0 and line 974 performs this check. In the common name path, we must deal with DirectoryString allowing any old string, so cmp_type is -1 and we run this code here.\n\nWhether we want that, I dunno, being strict would be cool but I suspect it would break lots of things, so maybe we defer that to the Chrome cert verifier vaporware. :-)\n\n(I believe this is covered by v3name_test.cc, which believes, among other things, that email addresses are valid DNS names...)",
