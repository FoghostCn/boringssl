Dunno how much in detail this should go. It\u0027s a rather wide net. SSL_CTX is ref-counted, so all SSL objects hanging off of it. Then there\u0027s any X509s or CRYPTO_BUFFERs you extract from those SSLs. And then there\u0027s any SSL_SESSIONs those SSLs they vend. I think that\u0027s exhaustive?\n\nPretty much this object just can\u0027t be deleted. :-)",
