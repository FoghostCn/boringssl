      "message": "This is *amazing* but I\u0027ll deal with it in a separate CL:\n- strtoul, which returns unsigned long, is being saved as a long anyway.\n- Then they check for negative values, nevermind that we were, again, calling strtoul\n- This function takes a (ptr, len) tuple but then passes it into a NUL-terminated strtoul, which *doesn\u0027t know the bounds*. Only reason this can\u0027t go out-of-bounds is this function can only be called on strings that are, ultimately, NUL-terminated.\n- strtoul is a mess because it\u0027s defined to return 0xff..ff instead when passed \"-1\", rather than it being an error.\n\nRight answer might be to just write our own, but ugh. :-(",
