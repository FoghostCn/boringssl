      "message": "In DTLS 1.2 (and prior), dtls1_set_read_state is called on receipt of a message in a new epoch. After dtls1_set_read_state is called, dtls1_bitmap_record will be called which will set the values in bitmap to appropriate values. (Specifically, dtls1_bitmap_record is called with a seq_num in the new epoch, so max_seq_num will be set and the shift from a seq_num in the old epoch to a new epoch will be much larger than the window size, so dtls1_bitmap_record will reset bitmap-\u003emap. The state that bitmap is tracking doesn\u0027t suddenly get invalidated by being in a new epoch.)\n\nIn DTLS 1.3, dtls1_set_read_state is called when the keys for that epoch are derived during the handshake, which is before that endpoint has received a message from its peer in the new epoch. Zeroing the bitmap here results in at least breakage of the `SSL_get_read_sequence` API (and WithVersion/SSLVersionTest.SequenceNumber/DTLS1_3 test case).",
