      "message": "There\u0027s an analogous one in aes-586.pl. Didn\u0027t find any others. I skimmed over references to 7 and 28 near an OPENSSL_ia32cap_P. The aes-586.pl version has a lot more text about what this is about:\nhttps://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/6c69aa532eee8a2cd1228b7810a926f2b752b864\n\nThere\u0027s... a lot of text, but I think it\u0027s trying to use smaller tables so it\u0027s harder to distinguish accesses at different offsets.\n\n(The commit that added it to the 64-bit version just talks about synchronizing the two.)",
