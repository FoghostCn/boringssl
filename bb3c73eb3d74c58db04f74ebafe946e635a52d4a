      "message": "What exactly are the implications of this attribute, other than working around a Cargo deficiency?\n\nThis talks about linking a native library, but we do not link a `libbssl.a`\nhttps://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-links-field\n\nThen this says links forces there to be exactly one copy of bssl-sys. This sounds... completely incoherent. This crate doesn\u0027t bundle a copy of BoringSSL. It doesn\u0027t seem like there are any actual consequences to having two of them, beyond the usual size consequences of duplicating any of them.\nhttps://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/build-scripts.html#the-links-manifest-key\n\nWhat in the world is Cargo doing here?",
