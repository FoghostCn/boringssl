That\u0027s what I do.\nhttps://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES.html\n\n(It\u0027s supposed to also work to pass `-DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES\u003dx86_64;arm64` to build a fat binary, but it doesn\u0027t due to how our asm build is set up. But I\u0027ve got some plans to address that. I can bump the priority a bit if that\u0027d be helpful!)",
