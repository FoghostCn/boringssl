CBB can fail if malloc fails *or* if the child CBB does not fit in the length prefixes. E.g. if `psk_len` exceeds 2^16. Likewise with other code using CBB.\n\nWhich actually means that this error was always incorrect. I think the easiest solution is to just make CBB push to the error queue on failure.",
