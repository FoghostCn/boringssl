Normally a function body in a header would need to be marked inline, and then we run into the root complication here that bindgen doesn\u0027t play well with inlines.\n\n(I\u0027m actually a little surprised this is building, since we enable the warning that requires function prototypes on everything. Maybe the flags aren\u0027t getting passed down?)",
