      "message": "I could see an argument for always adding the next_bio\u0027s value, but testing only on zero doesn\u0027t make much sense. (Although, as you note, the base64 BIO reports the number of base64 chars for BIO_pending, not the number of bytes that will result. So maybe it\u0027s always been a bit of a zero vs non-zero thing and thus the current behaviour reflects that.)\n\nHaving said that, /not/ chaining at all isn\u0027t obviously more correct. At least for BIO_pending, a reasonable meaning might be \"can I read bytes without doing I/O at this point?\". But I\u0027m not sure what the interpretation without chaining would be.",
