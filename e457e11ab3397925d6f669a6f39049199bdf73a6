      "message": "That was the reason I had them signed in the initial version. In the end it doesn\u0027t matter too much, as at the end of a function they have to be between 0 and 3328. In this specific function we need to read bitwise stored integers into these 0 to 3328 ints, with power being the offset coming from crossing a byte boundary. It should be the same type we use in scalar in general, which used to be int32_t, but was changed to uint16_t. One argument in favor of using unsigned here is that a bunch of bitshifting and other bitoperations happen in this function, and unless you go all in on \"it\u0027s 2-adic numbers, not integers\" those make little sense for signed integers.",

      "message": "\u003e What\u0027s the rationale around changing this from uint32_t in the previous version?\n\nAn unsigned type because it\u0027s a shift, and a shift had better not be negative.\nNot uint32_t because it\u0027s not inherently sized.\n\nBut I really could go either way. Looking at this code again prompted me to try rewriting it, which was worth a few percent speedup overall. And I used `int` there to fit in, so it goes.\n\nI also split off the 1-bit version of each into its own function, which is worth another few percent. (I want to be mindful of code-size, but the 1-bit case is very simple.)",
