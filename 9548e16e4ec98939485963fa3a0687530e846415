      "message": "No, we made the decision during the first evaluation that the static version of libcrypto is non-FIPS and is not allowed to be used for anything inside the security boundary. It\u0027s a separate, non-FIPS build target (libcrypto_static) with very limited visibility and static linking of libcrypto is disabled. We then went through a long process and changed pretty much everything that used to statically link libcrypto to dynamically link it.\n\nIt\u0027s been a while so I forget whether this was due to technical limitations (i.e. we couldn\u0027t get the integrity checks working on static builds) or system health reasons (our FIPS 140-2 flag files wouldn\u0027t work). \n\nAnyway, I\u0027ll clarify the wording.\n\nWill also have another revision later today which runs the break tests controlled by environment variables (RSA_PWCT, ECDSA_PWCT, CRNG).",
