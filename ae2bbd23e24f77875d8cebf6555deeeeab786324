I don\u0027t think git submodules use symlinks, and I thought gRPC was using the master-with-bazel branch these days, which pregenerates everything for you so you don\u0027t need to use this script. If you need the file lists in a different format, we can add it to the script and branch.",

      "message": "I\u0027m not sure either ðŸ˜Š For additional context here is my PR to gRPC: https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/23483\n\nFor the python build of GRPC.  The GRPC setup.py relies on files listed on \"src/python/grpcio/grpc_core_dependencies.py\" which is generated from a template on \"templates/src/python/grpcio/grpc_core_dependencies.py.template\" which in turn is updated when running \"tools/buildgen/generate_projects.sh\".  Without this change the only files that get found those contained in \"NON_PERL_FILES\" [1].\n\nI was developing on a GCE instance for this, I don\u0027t know if that has something to do with this, but you can compare the results with and without this change relative the PR I posted above with the following steps to see if you have a different outcome:\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/emkornfield/grpc.git\ncd grpc\ngit checkout fg\ngit submodule init\ngit submodule update\nvirtualenv ~/p22\nsource ~/p22/bin/activate\npip install mako\npip install pyyaml\n./tools/buildgen/generate_projects.sh\n```\n\n[1] https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/+/83b74c6a7a1ad33792be3adf10820ae287de8c40/util/generate_build_files.py#809",
