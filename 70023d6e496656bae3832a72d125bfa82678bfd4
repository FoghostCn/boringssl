Because those are not sufficient to make this call valid.\n\nI think the preconditions are actually: -1 \u003c\u003d dna,dnb \u003c\u003d 0. In fact, we\u0027re guaranteed that one of them is zero right now because of the i and j munging below. If they\u0027re both -1, I believe this algorithm would still work, but we\u0027re not currently calling it on that.",
