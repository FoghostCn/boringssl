      "message": "Yeah. I suppose we could abort(), but that seems a bit bad manners.\n\nThe cURL code is, incidentally, hilarious. They\u0027re calling it in some logging code to print out the certificate\u0027s PUBLIC KEY. I can probably send them a patch to not do that. In that case, we could possibly get away with just RSA_get0_key, though I would be surprised if other callers don\u0027t spring up. Think we should just punt on that function until then or just leave it in its multi-prime-blind state?",
