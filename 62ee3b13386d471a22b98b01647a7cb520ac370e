      "message": "It\u0027s a little unclear that every codepath here actually returns something, whereas the old code always had #else blocks in #if chains. Perhaps move the GHASH_ASM_X86 case in line 394 here down to the bottom? That ones different from the others because it\u0027s not runtime-guarded. So we\u0027d get all the runtime-guarded things out of the way first, and then the fallthrough cases? Though it does mean that if we, say, gained an unguarded GHASH_ASM_ARM case, we\u0027d need to say it twice. :-/\n\nI dunno. What do you think?",
