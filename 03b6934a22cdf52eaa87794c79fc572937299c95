      "message": "The aim was to write a test for ECH 0-RTT behavior on the server. So rather than a case that we know won\u0027t work (where the ECH server doesn\u0027t even think 0-RTT is going on), we should test that ECH doesn\u0027t impede 0-RTT. I\u0027ve removed this and replaced it with 0-RTT tests (and fixed various bugs in the tests).",
