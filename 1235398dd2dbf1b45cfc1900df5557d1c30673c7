      "message": "This came from a suggestion on https://boringssl-review.googlesource.com/c/boringssl/+/68027. It greatly cleans up the handling of epochs in DTLS 1.3. The downside I see in this change is that it\u0027s less obvious that the code is correct - with the old code you have current and previous epoch enums matching current and last aeads; now it\u0027s number comparisons and asserts to check that the numbers are correct. The DTLS 1.25 CL removes some of those asserts. (Maybe it\u0027s not a problem because this is the write path?)",
