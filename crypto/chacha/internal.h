/* CRYPTO_chacha_96_bit_nonce_from_64_bit_nonce formats a nonce for use with
 * |CRYPTO_chacha_20| that is compatible with the formulation used in older
 * versions. Previously |CRYPTO_chacha_20| used a 64 bit counter and tool a 64
 * bit nonce, whereas the current version uses a 32-bit counter and a 96-bit
 * nonce:
 *
 *       Old:     counter low || counter high || nonce low || nonce high
 *       New:  32-bit counter ||    nonce low || nonce mid || nonce high
 *      This:  32-bit counter ||            0 || nonce low || nonce high
 *
 * This allows an implementation of the old construction to be implemented with
 * |CRYPTO_chacha_20|, which implements the new construction, with the
 * limitation that no more than 2^32 blocks may be encrypted. An implementation
 * of a protocol that uses 96-bit counters as nonces cannot use this function,
 * though, since this function shifts the nonce 32 bits. */
