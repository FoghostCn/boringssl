      "message": "Now that this is gone, I believe you don\u0027t even need the read_end_of_early_data hook at all anymore. So instead ssl_hs_read_end_of_early_data means:\n\nThe handshake is paused until we\u0027ve received an end_of_early_data alert. Once it has been received, we call back into the handshake state machine.\n\nWe only need these sorts of method hooks if the DTLS/TLS-independent code needs to drive something, but reading end_of_early_data is implicit from SSL_read hitting it.",
