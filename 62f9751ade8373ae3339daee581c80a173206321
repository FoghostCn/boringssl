      "message": "In the C header the last two parameters are declared as `const u128 Htable[16], uint64_t *Xi),` which is different than what they are declared as here.\n\nI\u0027m not sure if you intended the `9` here while leaving `16` in the header file. It would be great if they matched.\n\nI think the correct declarations for these two parameters are `const u128 Htable[16], uint64_t Xip[2])` or maybe `Htable[9]` depending on what you\u0027re trying to do.\n\nI think there is a desire/hope/requirement that `Htable` and `Xip` are 16-byte aligned as well, which would be good to mention.\n\nIt would be nice if the documentation \u0026 declaration here and in the header were updated accordingly.",
