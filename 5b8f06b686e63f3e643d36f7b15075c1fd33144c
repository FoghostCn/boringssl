      "message": "What exactly are the implications of this file / future plans here? The CL description talks about a build system, but this file doesn\u0027t seem to actually describe how to build anything. We don\u0027t even have a Kconfig file, so the `kconfig-ext` file is a little surprising.\n\nThe link in [4] talks about integrating a project into Zephyr\u0027s default list of modules? Is that what you all are looking to do here? That sounds like a much bigger request of us than just carrying a file for you all.\n\nIf this is just ended to be a CrOS thing, is there any reason you all can\u0027t carry the file on your end?",
