      "message": "It\u0027s current state (otherwise the test would fail). What I was referring to is that, in TLS 1.3, the server message ordering is:\n\n  CertificateRequest\n  Certificate\n  CertificateVerify\n\nAlthough we get the CertificateRequest early, we must resolve the selected client certificate *after* verifying the certificate. (At the BoringSSL level. We also want to do it at the Chromium level, but that\u0027s what you\u0027re fixing.) We do this, but I wanted to make sure we didn\u0027t regress that.\n\nDoes that clarify things?",
