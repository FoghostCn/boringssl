      "message": "Hmm. So the history of this file is that Chrome used to not own the root store, which meant that revocations had to be applied after the fact. In the long term, I hope we can do this by simply removing the roots and maybe having some path from CRLsets straight to here.\n\nGiven that CCV doesn\u0027t have a root store either, I\u0027d be inclined to say that this sort of policy decisions should live with whether you got your root store from. But I haven\u0027t thought about this much. Something to discuss perhaps.",
