      "message": "This is a follow up https://boringssl-review.googlesource.com/c/boringssl/+/52205. With that change we can use BoringSSL as a drop-in OpenSSL replacement for projects that consume OpenSSL through CMake\u0027s `find_package(OpenSSL)` like cURL, but recently we also ran into projects that use `find_package(OpenSSL 1.1.1)` like cpp-httplib. We cannot directly integrate BoringSSL into these projects. A potential alternative I can think of is to modify the existing logic in those projects to use `find_package(OpenSSL)` and then try to manually detect if we\u0027re using BoringSSL and if so omit the version.",
