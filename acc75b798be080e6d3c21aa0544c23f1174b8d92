      "message": "What\u0027s the rationale behind bringing this in here? Since this is a bindgen library and boringssl is already running these tests, does it make any sense to run this again?   I\u0027m thinking here that the tests need to be that yes indeed, the same input to boringssl HMAC gives you same in rust, but for example, we do not *re-do* the wycheproof tests in boringssl when calling HMAC through a c++ wrapper to the C funcitons....",

      "message": "That\u0027s a good point, I guess I agree that they are not needed, but it was just the easiest way to verify that the bindings were still working correctly, and that there weren\u0027t any issues with how the types and bytes were passed across the boundary. Given they are already implemented, is there any harm in leaving them? If not, what would be the best approach to testing, just a couple of main test cases and edge cases instead of the whole list of vectors?",
