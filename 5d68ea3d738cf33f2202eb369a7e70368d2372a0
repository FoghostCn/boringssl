There\u0027s a decent number of callers internally (never mind that a lot of them added a cast because the original API wasn\u0027t this), so we\u0027d have to change those. And anything that\u0027s third-party, we\u0027d be maintaining patches for indefinitely, unless we can convince their upstreams to take an #ifdef or (const void *) cast.",
