      "message": "Yes and no.\n\nAFAICT, `BN_mod_exp_mont_consttime` is designed to protect the exponent and the base, and `BN_mod_exp_mont` is *supposed* to protect the base. The main (maybe only) difference between the two is that `BN_mod_exp_mont` does a bunch of BN_correct_tops and related badness. So in theory `BN_mod_exp_mont` would be better but `BN_mod_exp_mont_consttime` is probably slightly better. But, the same could be said for RSA_encrypt and every other use of `BN_mod_exp_mont` except signature verification.\n\nI believe in one of my earler patches, I\u0027d tried to switch this to `BN_mod_exp_mont_consttime` to account for the badness in `BN_mod_exp_mont` but I think we agreed to not do so. If we want to change to `BN_mod_exp_consttime` then let\u0027s due so in another CL that also adjust other, similar, cases.",
