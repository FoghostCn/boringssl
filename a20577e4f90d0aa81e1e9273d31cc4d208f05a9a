      "message": "Oh yeah, I was thinking we\u0027d might want this someday for porting the ssl/ stuff over, mostly for EVP_DigestSignFinal and friends. Though the EVP ones are a little weirder in that passing in a NULL data sometimes gives you an upper bound for the length rather than the final length itself. I was thinking we might want a pair like CBB_reserve + CBB_advance or something.\n\nAnyway, let\u0027s just leave this as-is for now. We can cross that bridge when we come to it.",
