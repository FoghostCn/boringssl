      "message": "So EC_POINT_oct2point actually checks this internally (and so the SSL code already doesn\u0027t have a problem). What do you think about making EC_POINT_set_affine_coordinates_GFp check it?\n\nI.e. have the type system and API enforce that \"if you successfully got an EC_POINT, it\u0027s actually in the corresponding EC_GROUP\". Also it means we only check once. :-)\n\nOr is that a check we don\u0027t want to do when just creating points willy-nilly? Other than performance, my main worry is about code which assumes today EC_POINT_set_affine_coordinates_GFp only fails on malloc errors or something.",
