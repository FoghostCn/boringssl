      "message": "Optional: Worth adding a TSan regression test? The C++11 threading APIs make this pretty nice. (Grep for tests gated by OPENSSL_THREADS.)\n\nTo run locally, I do:\n-DTSAN\u003d1\n-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE\u003dsome/toolchain/file/for/clang\n-DUSE_CUSTOM_LIBCXX\u003d1\n\nThe last one requires util/bot/libcxx and util/bot/libcxxabi to contain the repos from DEPS. I just have them manually cloned in my checkout because I\u0027ve no idea how to convince gclient to adopt an existing repo.",
