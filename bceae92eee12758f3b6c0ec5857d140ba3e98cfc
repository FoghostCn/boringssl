We use BN_mod_inverse_blinded for RSA things, because the modulus is not a prime.\n\nFor ECC, we\u0027re just inverting modulo a prime and typically use Fermat\u0027s Little Theorem and just raise to the p-2.\n\nI would say we probably should move BN_mod_inverse_blinded to a private header. But I see some other code uses it. That code probably should move to BoringSSL in time, but I suppose that\u0027s a lot more work. (We\u0027re not trying to support general-purpose constant-time BIGNUM operations. Most of the true constant-time stuff is private to the library. There are a lot of subtleties around the widths of your BIGNUMs that, due to API constraints, we have to track implicitly in confusing ways.)",
