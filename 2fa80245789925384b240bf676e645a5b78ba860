      "message": "You could maybe argue this test is more of scar tissue than anything meaningful. It\u0027s a consequence of the old logic trying to take lots of different shortcuts around complete fragments and fragments received in order. I don\u0027t expect we\u0027ll ever care enough to resurrect those shortcuts. There\u0027s tidier ways to avoid the extra copy anyway, like the buffer-sharing thing in the commit message.",
