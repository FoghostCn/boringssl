Let\u0027s see if we can figure out a better way to solve your problem. I suspect you will need to temporarily import libpki as part of Cronet and not part of BoringSSL, to avoid version skew problems.",

I thought there was still to be a little version skew. I remember a long discussion and us concluding that you all were going to live with some version skew. (I\u0027ll follow-up with you out-of-band with a link.) That won\u0027t work well with libpki right now. (Once we\u0027ve gotten a proper API boundary between the two, it\u0027ll be a bit less tight.)",
