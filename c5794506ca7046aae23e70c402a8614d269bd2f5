      "message": "It sounds like you\u0027re asking us to support WASI. Platform support is quite expensive, so we don\u0027t generally support platforms we can\u0027t test, or where there isn\u0027t a need on our end to support them.\n\nIn addition to whether we want to support it, this CL doesn\u0027t seem to be doing it right. Rather than doing it at the build level, we usually do this in code, so it\u0027s build-system-agnostic. Looks like WASI defines the `__wasi__` preprocessor symbol, so we could exclude it based on that.\n\nAlthough, is that even correct? I see the \"[preview1](https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/blob/main/legacy/preview1/docs.md)\" iteration of WASI has sockets. I see that\u0027s \"legacy\" and there\u0027s also a \"preview 2\" but that seems to be empty? I haven\u0027t been following WASI very clearly, but it doesn\u0027t seem to quite yet exist.\n\nIn the meantime, short of official support, you can always set options via `CMAKE_C_FLAGS` and `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS`.",

      "message": "Thanks for the detailed reply. I was building BoringSSL through Cloudflare\u0027s `boring` Rust crate. With setting that option I can get it compiled with the wasm32-wasi target.\n\nAs I\u0027ve seen other defines in the CMakeLists.txt I thought I give it a shot, but I totally get if it\u0027s something you don\u0027t want to add (every additional bit needs maintenance). I will probably take the `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS` route which should be good enough. The WASI toolchain is using depends on Clang, so I also don\u0027t even need to deal with different compilers.",
