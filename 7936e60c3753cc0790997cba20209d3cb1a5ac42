      "message": "Annoyingly, I do see one user of it in the public API. Honestly, if `X509_ALGOR` were opaque (and once we\u0027d decoupled this from `crypto/asn1/tasn_*.c`... been 80% of the way to that for a while now), I\u0027d probably replace the `ASN1_TYPE *` with an embedded one and a boolean. Or maybe we use whether the `ASN1_TYPE` has type -1 or something gross like that.\n\nBut that would require the struct be opaque, and we\u0027re not quite there yet. (Upstream didn\u0027t make it opaque, so some 3p packages still reach in.)\n\nReally I\u0027d like us to stop believing in malloc failures at this layer, but we haven\u0027t worked through that yet.",
