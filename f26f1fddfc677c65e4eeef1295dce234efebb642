      "message": "This list enumerates the platforms that BoringSSL supports. For those platforms we keep a reasonable bar of not breaking them: automated test coverage, for one, but also we need access to those types for machines for fixing them. If people want to run BoringSSL on other platforms it\u0027s on them and things may not work.\n\nHowever, we well know that anything that seems to work will soon be expected to work and, quickly, the implicit expectation is that every machine will work always. (See what happened to OpenSSL.)\n\nSo this list marks the boundary of what we guarantee. Of course, you can run the code any many more machines, but then you\u0027re taking on the burden of fixing it and, if you\u0027re doing that, then you must be able to carry local patches. In which case patching this list is trivial.",
