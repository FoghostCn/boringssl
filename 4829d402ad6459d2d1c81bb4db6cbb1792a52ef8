My intention is to do all of sha{1,256,512}_block_data_order per architecture (now Aarch64, next x86-64).\n\nSince we need to change the coverage test in a way that\u0027s going to require more conditional-on-target-arch logic anyway, I\u0027ll work on that and the x86-64 a bit and see if a better solution comes to me in the process.",
