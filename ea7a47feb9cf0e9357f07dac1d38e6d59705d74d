      "message": "Being super picky here, probably a 0 byte size should return 0 (because read does this and is therefore indistinguishable from EOF in this case) but a negative size should EINVAL, rather than look suspiciously like EOF.\n\nThis is the case for read if size (which is size_t in that case) would be larger than SSIZE_MAX, so would be roughly analagous in this case.",

      "message": "I guess it depends on whether you believe `BIO_gets(bio, buf, -1)` means \"I am doing something absurd and think `buf` has room for -1 bytes\" or \"please read up at most -1 bytes into `buf`\".\n\nI\u0027d normally agree with you except actually this bit is moot because the `BIO_gets` wrapper code checks for this anyway. I only put this in to make it locally obvious.\n\nAlthough, interestingly, OpenSSL upstream actually takes the former interpretation and makes the `BIO_gets` wrapper raise `BIO_R_INVALID_ARGUMENT` on -1. So maybe we should fix the wrapper...\n\nInterestingly, that\u0027s the opposite interpretation that they have for `BIO_read` and `BIO_write`, where -1 is just successfully reading/writing zero bytes.",
