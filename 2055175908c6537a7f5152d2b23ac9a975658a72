      "message": "Thing to note: if this is called before the final version is determined (way at the bottom in the ServerHello sniff), the SSL_SESSION gets a bad ssl_version burned into it which confuses things (this is the bug in the DTLS code right now). Hence which this code makes it NULL rather than call ssl_get_new_session.\n\nGiven that SSLv23_client_method left it NULL before, I don\u0027t think this exposes any new codepaths where we\u0027d have a NULL s-\u003esession that we didn\u0027t have before.",
