      "message": "This logic is still kind of a mess, despite being rewritten a couple times already. :-/\n\nIf we lost the sid_ctx stuff and also the SSL_CTX_remove_session call, things could be a lot simpler. (And we\u0027d shave a bit of per-connection memory!) But I\u0027ve left that alone for now since both will want some investigation.\n\n(My initial thought was sid_ctx should be via SSL_CTX, but that probably interacts funny with SNI and SSL_set_SSL_CTX and session resumption.)",
