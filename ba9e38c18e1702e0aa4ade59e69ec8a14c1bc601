      "message": "It\u0027s a fair point. The answer is that this reflects the order in the ACVP protocol and I probably didn\u0027t think hard enough originally. But there are other users now and reordering would mess with them. (I\u0027m not totally sure if we need to support the non-reseed mode now. It might be that the server will only ask us to reseed if we support it, but I\u0027m not confident and it\u0027s expensive to find out later.)",
