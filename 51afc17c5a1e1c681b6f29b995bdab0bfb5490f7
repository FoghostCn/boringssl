      "message": "It doesn\u0027t really matter since our own headers will tolerate either. extern \"C++\" is the default though, so wrapper #includes in it should always be safe.\n\nAlthough... actually there\u0027s a bigger problem here which is that public headers can\u0027t include internal ones. Removed. It wasn\u0027t necessary anyway.",
