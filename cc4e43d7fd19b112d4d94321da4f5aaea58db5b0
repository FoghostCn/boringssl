      "message": "My understanding is that Shay Gueron and Vlad Krasnov had replaced the gather-scatter techniques with the select functions in x86_64 code. OpenSSL team first accepted them, then found the performance to be worse on non-SIMD processors so they reverted back to gather-scatter techniques and wrote the Arm code to follow. BoringSSL kept them in the x86_64 assembly code.\n\nReference: In my initial investigation of the history of the x86_64 code, this link was alive https://rt.openssl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id\u003d3149\u0026user\u003dguest\u0026pass\u003dguest, which is no longer the case.\nFragments of the conversation, unfortunately without the patches, can be found in:\n- https://groups.google.com/g/mailing.openssl.dev/c/q6qitLHf874\n- https://groups.google.com/g/mailing.openssl.dev/c/TZ0P25zFVoM/m/vyAMqow3E2sJ\n- https://groups.google.com/g/mailing.openssl.dev/c/bRjH9eSBNbM/m/2bG3cVzL5yQJ\n- https://groups.google.com/g/mailing.openssl.dev/c/eygo0LdPbMk/m/fPQgO2OWlRYJ\n(I had saved one of the patches from the original review link).\n\nOn another note, I had first implemented them exactly as in x86_64 up until you asked about them, Adam, which reminded me that I had experimented with another way to write them, using the BIT instruction instead of the AND/OR combination. It is one of the instructions that can be guaranteed to be constant-time by the DIT setting in https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0595/2021-06/AArch64-Registers/DIT--Data-Independent-Timing.\nI updated the commit message with the slightly better performance measurement.",
