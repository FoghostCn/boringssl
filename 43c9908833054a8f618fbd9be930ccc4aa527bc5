Arithmetic error. :-)\n\nI\u0027ll go tighten up the comment slightly, but otherwise this looks good.\n\n(There\u0027s actually a much older citation for the 1/4 bound, which comes from the paper that originally derived the values for uniformly-distributed primes. But this one works too.)",

It therefore may aid users in choosing between BN_prime_checks_for_validation and BN_prime_checks_for_generation and serve as a resource for both comments.",
