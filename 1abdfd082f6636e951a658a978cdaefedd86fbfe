      "message": "Worth a comment? I had to draw out the cases to convince myself, but then I thought about it after the fact and decided that was unnecessary. (delta++ confused me, but then I realized delta++ cannot make negative into positive or positive into negative, only negative to zero and zero to positive, hence the special case at zero.)",

      "message": "Doesn\u0027t delta_zero imply mask \u003d\u003d 0? So ~mask \u0026 delta_zero is I think the same as delta_zero. (And if we did swap with delta \u003d\u003d 0, it wouldn\u0027t matter because 0 \u003d\u003d -0 and we sample delta_zero post-swap anyway.)\n\n(I think the LHS can likewise be just delta_is_positive \u0026 ~mask, but ^ doesn\u0027t require reasoning about mask or getting at andnot instructions.)\n\nDitto throughout.",
