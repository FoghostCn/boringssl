      "message": "Why does runner need to implement ECH GREASE? Runner implements specific things so that we can test how C reacts to it. It also tests that C sends what we expect. It does not need to implement any random selection of values.\n\nFor comparison, note that we do not implement sending GREASE ciphers or anything else in runner. Rather, runner\u0027s knowledge of GREASE is that it can be configured to *require* the client send it, in order to test that, when asked, the client actually does send it.\n\nThe runner is not a TLS implementation, it\u0027s a TLS tester. They\u0027re similar but not the same.",

      "message": "I see your point.Â The server is supposed to respond to bad ECH values in a certain way, but it can\u0027t distinguish GREASE from \"real\" ECH encrypted with the wrong keys. So runner doesn\u0027t need an ECH GREASE implementation.\n\nIf I un-expose NewKDF, should I do the same for the other functions in kem.go? Do we only expose functions that have a present need to be called from outside the package?",
