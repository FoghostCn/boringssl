      "message": "We silently round `bits` down to a whole number of words or so, so we don\u0027t actually support every bit size here. I suspect we can loosen that to just even numbers by now (overexcited BIGNUM avoidance in an early iteration of the sqrt(2) logic), but odd `bits` require tweaking some stuff. `bits/2` would put sqrt(2) on the other bound.\n\nIs there a particular reason we need to support awkward key sizes, or a particular size we needed?",
