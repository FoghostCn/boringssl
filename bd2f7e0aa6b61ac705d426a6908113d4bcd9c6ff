The short argument is that, independently of the value of c, s1, or s2, the rejection probability is beta/gamma1 for each coefficient of z and beta/gamma2 for each coefficient of r0. Since this probability does not depend on c, knowing c does not help the attacker.\n\nNote that w1 and r0 *have* to be kept secret in case a rejection happens. Knowing c and w1 does leak parts of the secret in the rejection case.",

      "message": "The reason is btw the same as with leaking c: Aborting probability is always beta/gamma1 for each coefficient of z and beta/gamma2 for each coefficient of r0. That means you can have a zero knowledge with aborts simulator, that will either output a valid transcript or output abort together with a valid c, and you can prove that this simulator makes the protocol zero knowledge, i.e. is information theoretically indistinguishable from a real protocol. The Fiat-Shamir with aborts transform then turns the whole thing into a signature scheme.",
