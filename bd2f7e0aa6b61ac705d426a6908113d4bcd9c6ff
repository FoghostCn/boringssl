The short argument is that, independently of the value of c, s1, or s2, the rejection probability is beta/gamma1 for each coefficient of z and beta/gamma2 for each coefficient of r0. Since this probability does not depend on c, knowing c does not help the attacker.\n\nNote that w1 and r0 *have* to be kept secret in case a rejection happens. Knowing c and w1 does leak parts of the secret in the rejection case.",
