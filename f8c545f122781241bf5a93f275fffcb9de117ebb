      "message": "Self-review: if in.empty() but we have a pending_flight (deferred NewSessionTicket) to write, we\u0027ll stash an empty span into pending_write and still run through this.\n\nThis is intentional in that we want SSL_write(NULL, 0) to flush NewSessionTicket, but if that flush fails partway through and the next retry has \u003e 0 bytes, we\u0027ll trip SSL_R_BAD_RETRY. I think that should skip the pointer check should skip the pointer check if the buffer is empty.\n\nMight be better as a follow-up CL. Also write a test.\n\n(Ugh, this API...)",
