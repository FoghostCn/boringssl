Having an OPENSSL_STANDARD_TYPENAME is pretty silly, but given the alternative is to still have a new type for next_timeout_storage anyway.\n\nWould also be nice to OPENSSL_COMPILE_ASSERT that this timeval is the same size as the Windows one, though that would require a file with winsock.h included.",
