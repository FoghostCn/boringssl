      "message": "Indeed, with the change, there will be some temporary values that have the `BN_FLG_CONSTTIME` flag set that didn\u0027t have it set previously. But, none of the functions called by this function look at `BN_FLG_CONSTTIME` except `BN_div` and `BN_nnmod`, and those calls are the ones that force us to muck with `BN_FLG_CONSTTIME` in the first place.\n\nNote, in particular, that the only non-local (`BN_CTX`-owned) value that is modified in this function is `out`, and that this function never sets any flags on `out`.\n\nI can revert the changes to this function if you still aren\u0027t convinced. The main goal of changing this is to remove `BN_with_flags` from the security analysis of RSA/ECDSA/ECDH, which is something of value (only) when combined with many similar changes to reduce the amount of relevant code.\n\nLMK.",
