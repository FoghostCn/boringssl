      "message": "The use case for this API (at least in OpenSSL) is to limit the number of available curves when automatic negotiation is enabled via SSL_CTX_set_ecdh_auto(), for example, to protect from DoS attacks that would negotiate the most CPU-intensive curve available in OpenSSL.\n\nThis is a bit less useful in BoringSSL, because the default list contains only two curves (P-256 \u0026 P-384), but it can still be used to limit the automatic negotiation to P-256 only.\n\nBut, as far as I recall, the automatic negotiation (or this API?) didn\u0027t work in BoringSSL last time I checked, anyway.",
