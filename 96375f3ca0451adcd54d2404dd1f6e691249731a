      "message": "This isn\u0027t quite right, since macOS also counts as \"UNIX\". Unfortunately, detecting Linux seems to be a bit tricky. UNIX AND NOT APPLE will... mostly target ELF targets, but it\u0027s probably still not right to use \"linux\" on, say, FreeBSD. Elsewhere, we check if CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME is Linux. That\u0027s probably the thing to do here.\n\nNote that CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME on \"Android\" is not \"Linux\" but Android. But that\u0027s probably desirable, because the target name for Android is aarch64-linux-android. It uses a different libc and I think there are some slight differences in places.\n\nAnother option is to just make the caller specify it, and it\u0027s their problem if they don\u0027t match.",
