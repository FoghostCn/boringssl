      "message": "Accepting whitespace here is interesting. It\u0027s not like `1.2.3.4   ` is an IP address either. Or `1.2.3.4 nope` But I suppose `sscanf` itself skips over leading whitespace, so it is consistent. Whether *that* is desirable, I dunno.\n\nI\u0027ll go look over the callers to see what\u0027s up, but was there a particular reason you write this to accept trailing data?",
