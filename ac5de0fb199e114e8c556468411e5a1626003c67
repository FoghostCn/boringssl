(Also there\u0027s a headache because GCC\u0027s -Wconversion complains requires a cast on uint8_t a, b, c; c \u003d a + b; because a + b technically has type int via integer promotion.)",

      "message": "I don\u0027t know if I\u0027d call it a particular conscious effort. Every use of fiat_p256_limb_t I see feeds into fiat code, which expects the corresponding limb size.\n\nNote that fiat_p256_limb_t and crypto_word_t aren\u0027t the same. The 64-bit fiat code depends on uint128_t, which isn\u0027t always available. (I think at one point we tried making fiat output the MSVC intrinsic and it crashed MSVC.)",
