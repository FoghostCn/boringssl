When we discussed this for crypto/x509, I think we opted not to due to this warning:\nhttps://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormatStyleOptions.html#insertbraces\n\nThen again, Chrome seems to have enabled it just fine, and I actually can\u0027t think of cases where the code formatting would be wrong, unless you do something stupid like `#define if something_else`.\n\nWDYT? I\u0027m perfectly happy including it if you are.",
