      "message": "I\u0027m a little puzzled why the compiler can\u0027t prove these aren\u0027t unused anymore. This is an issue at all because this function is awkwardly two-pass. It probably made more sense back when RSA SKX and DH(E) SKX were the only ones that exist, and we\u0027d fill in |r|, |nr|, and |kn| and then go on to some shared code. I have a cleanup to just make a single-pass that avoids this, but it\u0027s blocking on also porting this to CBB to replace the BUF_MEM_grow call.",
