For a 16-byte output, perhaps we should just remove this requirement? It seems kinda annoying.",

For callers within BoringSSL, it\u0027s somewhat ok to cheat.\n\nThe alignment is annoying and I go back and forth on it. It\u0027s pleasing to have everything lined up working smoothly but, without type-system support, it\u0027s difficult to get right. If you wrote a patch to do the needed memcpy, I would very likely cave.",
