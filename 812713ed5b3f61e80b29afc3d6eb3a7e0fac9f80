      "message": "Strictly speaking this wouldn\u0027t be true if we had another mont5 platform, but even in OpenSSL, the only other mont5 platform is SPARC T4. :-)\n\nFWIW, we do appear to have gotten away with a 6k buffer in ec_GFp_simple_mul_single, and tool/rand.cc even uses 12k of stack space. And, alloca macro issues aside, we did previously believe 3072 was an acceptable stack allocation. I do know of one consumer who might be unhappy at this, but they\u0027re a little fuzzy right now, are unlikely care about RSA private keys, and have a hand-curated subset of the library anyway. So we can cross that bridge if we ever come to it and, in the meantime, I\u0027m happy to try doing this unconditionally.",
