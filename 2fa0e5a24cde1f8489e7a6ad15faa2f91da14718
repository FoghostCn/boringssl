      "message": "The expression \"if (a+b\u003ec) a\u003dc-b\" is incorrect if \"a+b\" overflows. It should be replaced by \"if (a\u003ec-b) a\u003dc-b\", which avoids the potential overflow and is much easier to understand. This pattern is the root cause of CVE-2022-37454, a buffer overflow vulnerability in the \"official\" SHA-3 implementation.\n\nIt has been confirmed that the addition in crypto/fipsmodule/hkdf/hkdf.c:97 cannot overflow. So this is only a minor change proposal to avoid a potentially vulnerable code pattern and to improve readability. (And to make BoringSSL more \"boring\"!)
