      "message": "The problem is that |EC_GROUP_new_curve_GFp| doesn\u0027t set the order. |EC_GROUP_set_generator| does. It would be best if you could combine |EC_GROU_new_curve_GFp| and |EC_GROUP_set_generator| into one function. It would be easy to do if you can also modify the code that us using |EC_GROUP_new_curve_GFp| (I believe it is conscript) to use the new function. That\u0027s something that\u0027s not reasonable for me to do as I don\u0027t deal with conscript.",
