      "message": "This is kind of weird and you might want to check me on this. Previously, X509_ATTRIBUTE_new could not fill in attr-\u003evalue.set because it was a CHOICE and thus it leaves it all NULL. This means new(); set1_data() behaved correctly. But set1_data() on a non-empty attr leaked.\n\nNow that it\u0027s not a CHOICE, attr-\u003eset is always initialized by the mess in tsan_new.c, so there\u0027s no need to initialize it. But, in doing so, they changed the behavior from overwriting to appending.",
