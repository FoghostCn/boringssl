      "message": "I don\u0027t especially care for `EVP_CIPHER_CTX_ctrl` and `EVP_CTRL_*` as public APIs, but that\u0027s where OpenSSL is, and it\u0027s probably not worth the fuss to diverge here. Especially for an AES-GCM API that we don\u0027t even like anyway. ðŸ˜Š So while I actually prefer your version of the ctrl over theirs in a vacuum, I\u0027m inclined to just match upstream in both calling it `EVP_CTRL_GET_IVLEN` and using an `int *` out-param. Kinda odd, but I suppose it works. *shrug*\n\nTo make it private, we could just add a new function pointer on `EVP_CIPHER`. (Unlike upstream, we don\u0027t believe in user-defined `EVP_CIPHER`s.) But I think just doing the silly ioctl is fine.",
