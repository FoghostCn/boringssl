Actually this one can be trimmed down a bit because there\u0027s no False Start, but the server half\u0027s retain_only_sha256_of_client_certs would get duplicated.\n\nIf the goal is just SSL_CB_CONNECT_LOOP, I think https://boringssl-review.googlesource.com/19524 would do the trick. We\u0027d then make the TLS 1.2 state switch-case, at state_tls13 or so forward to the TLS 1.3 function.",
