      "message": "I\u0027m certainly a fan of fewer things being our responsibility! :-)\n\nI\u0027ll tidy that up in a follow-up, just to reduce the number of things this CL is changing. (Also because we\u0027ll need to fiddle with things a bit if we need a `.bazelrc` due to the bizarre way that branch is generated... we need to fix that.)\n\nLooking around, I take it the preferred story for things that come from the toolchain is:\n\n- `BUILD` file is agnostic to warnings, C++ version (C version?), etc. Whoever invokes `bazel` picks this up.\n\n- When the library is consumed in a project, we expect that to come from whatever the library does\n\n- When the library is the root of the dependency tree, if we don\u0027t have any particular toolchain preferences, just want to test stuff works, we\u0027d put flags in `.bazelrc`\n\n- You can\u0027t write `select` in `.bazelrc`, but you can specify different named \"configs\", and so we\u0027d have one for Windows that does the MSVC spelling, one for Linux, etc.\n\n- We can set `--enable_platform_specific_config` to pick up a default so that you don\u0027t have to remember to, on Windows, say `--config\u003dwindows`.\n\nIs that right?",
