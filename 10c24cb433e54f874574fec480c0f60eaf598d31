      "message": "For your amusement, we found someone with a broken build where they were passing `-mgoldmont`, which implies SHA extensions, and then expecting the binary to run on something that didn\u0027t support everything Goldmont supports. ðŸ˜Š\n\nNot a problem. I expect we can just get them to fix their build and don\u0027t need to temporarily remove the `__SHA__` ifdef (though that wouldn\u0027t be the end of the world), but amusing nonetheless.",
