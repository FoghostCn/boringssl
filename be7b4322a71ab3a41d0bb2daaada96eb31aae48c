      "message": "(Hah, Gerrit ported this old comment over).\n\nNah, this is \"kdf\". This identifier specifies the entire KDF. The reason EVP_HPKE_get_hkdf_md is \"hkdf\" is because it returns just the digest and we need to specify HKDF for it to be meaningful.\n\nHow to tell:\n\nImagine if we added HKDFv2. HKDFv2 is like HKDF in that it\u0027s parametrized by a hash. Or maybe it\u0027s not parametrized by a hash but by a block cipher like AES-128! HPKE would then add HKDFv2_SHA256 code points. EVP_HPKE_CTX_get_(h)kdf_id could return those code points without any fuss.\n\nHowever, EVP_HPKE_get_(h)kdf_md would not be reusable for HKDFv2 because all the callers expect to pass that digest into HKDF, not HKDFv2. If HKDFv2 isn\u0027t hash-parametrized, there might not even be anything to return.",
