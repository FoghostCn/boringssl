      "message": "I\u0027m not personally a fan of this approach. I think that the usage of QEMU could be implicitly determined by the presence of the qemu-binary string. However...I noticed that the existing art in this test runner (e.g. useSDE and sdePath) point towards having explicit flags. If the team is okay with it, I think it\u0027d be much cleaner to implicitly use QEMU based on the presence of the binary string.",

If we know the toolchain root used for the build, I think we could theoretically find the linker and libraries. Perhaps we don\u0027t have access to that info, or perhaps that would be attempting to be a bit too clever. Let me know what you think!",

For instance, I don\u0027t believe the combination of useSDE and simulateARMCPUs is valid, nor the combination of useValgrind / useCallgrind. There are a number of places in this script which do some of this validation. I think it\u0027d be beneficial to consolidate and make that validation be front-loaded and explicit. Lmk what you think!\n\nIf this isn\u0027t useful, I\u0027ll scrap this bit and do the validation elsewhere.",
