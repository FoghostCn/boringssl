Is it worth keeping this code around at all, or should we just ditch it all?\n\n(Ditching it means that EC_GROUPs are finally immutable, which means we can save all the EC_GROUP_dups and make them .rodata. Although we could do that anyway and just burn the precomputed bits into rodata too if that\u0027s valuable.)",
