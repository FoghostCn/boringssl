      "message": "Thoughts on stealing the zero value? It\u0027s mildly gross, but zero isn\u0027t actually an allowed tag (we reject it as of https://crbug.com/boringssl/455), but the alternative is this function, and the new versions of tasn_enc.c and tasn_dec.c need a pair of arguments `int has_tag, CBS_ASN1_TAG tag`, so I went with this one. But I can switch to the other convention if we prefer that one.",
