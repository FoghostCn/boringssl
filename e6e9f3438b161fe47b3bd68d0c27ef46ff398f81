I think it\u0027s worth reusing existing test vectors where possible.\n\nI have a branch I\u0027m working on that adds a file-based test framework based roughly on our aead_test.c and upstream\u0027s new evp_test.c. It imports upstream\u0027s HMAC tests which cover more hash functions. (Those test vectors supposedly come from NIST.)",
