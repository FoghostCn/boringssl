The new patchset has a few additional changes beyond what you asked for:\n\n* Auto-canonicalizing the domain name (adding trailing dot) to be nice to the command-line user.\n* Now processes all HTTPS records in the response.\n* Command-line -out-file has changed to -out-dir, so we can write N ECHConfigList values to disk without potentially bombing the current dir.\n",
