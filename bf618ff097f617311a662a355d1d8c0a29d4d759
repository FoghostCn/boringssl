      "message": "This one passes ownership to the caller, which would need to RSA_free it, so leaving it const doesn\u0027t really work.\n\nPerhaps that means it should get1 : const EVP_PKEY* -\u003e RSA*, which means it doesn\u0027t need to overload... but if we\u0027re resigned to adding that, then trying to avoid get0 : const EVP_PKEY* -\u003e RSA* is sort of questionable too...\n\nSigh. Honestly, I think the actual answer is EC_KEYs and RSAs should be immutable after construction, but we\u0027d need to convince upstream to break the API again for 1.2.0 first. Ditch RSA_set0_key and friends in favor of RSA_new_public and RSA_new_private.",
