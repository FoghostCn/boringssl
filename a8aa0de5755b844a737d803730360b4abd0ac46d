I tried to derive it from first principles and I think I either found a simpler way of implementing the same math, or I am overlooking something.\n\nSee https://boringssl-review.googlesource.com/c/boringssl/+/63905 where I at least determined (at least, as far as I can tell) that crypto_test isn\u0027t testing all the stuff that seems relevant for the more complicated logic that exists today.",
