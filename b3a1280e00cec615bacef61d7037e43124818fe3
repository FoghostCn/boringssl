      "message": "Sadness. Alright, chatting with Adam, I think the plan is this:\n\n- Land this and test vectors because we should be giving the correct answer and, if point three fails, at least this means RSAZ-1024 will be on track to actually giving correct answers. Correct answers are pretty cool.\n- Then I\u0027ll go rip out RSAZ-512 since it only helps with 1024-bit RSA and, looking at the numbers, it\u0027s not pulling its weight.\n- Nothing external calls BN_mod_exp_mont_consttime. Unexport that and I\u0027ll see if I can just make BN_mod_exp_mont_consttime require its inputs be reduced. This is silly.",
