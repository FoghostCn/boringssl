If you are interested in switching this to a data-file-based test, LMK and I will submit a CL for that.",

This particular test was already in C++, so I continued that. I also wouldn\u0027t object to it being data-file-based. *shrug* If you\u0027d prefer these file-based, go for it.\n\nI\u0027ve also emailed the Wycheproof folks, so hopefully the inputs will be in there later.",
