      "message": "This doesn\u0027t quite describe the state of affairs. TRUST_TOKEN_experiment_v0 still has the bug, which means, relative to the API docs, any private metadata bits you encode are leaked and the TRUST_TOKEN_decode_private_metadata function doesn\u0027t actually work.\n\nGiven the exp0 construction isn\u0027t really workable, perhaps it\u0027s better to just document that private metadata isn\u0027t private in exp0. I assume you still need TRUST_TOKEN_decode_private_metadata to extract the correct value for testing purposes, so I guess it should be documented that, in exp0, you use client data instead of token hash?",
