We might also be in some weird state if ssl_add_message_cbb succeeded but tls13_rotate_traffic_key failed! So this should probably just be fatal. But it\u0027s kinda odd to stick a fatal error if we *just* succeeded in the write anyway. :-)\n\n(To that end... that\u0027s a good reason why non-I/O failures on the write path should be as sticky as the read path. Probably need to spend some time on that one...)",
