      "message": "What M and L? It looks like you\u0027ve done the IETF\u0027s AEAD_AES_128_CCM, so it should be documented as such, but that\u0027s not the one the Bluetooth folks need. See https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/bluetooth-core-specification, volume 6, part E. They use M \u003d 4 and L \u003d 2.\n\nIt looks like AES-CCM does actually encode M and L into the AD and where CTR mode starts, so in theory we could have a single EVP_AEAD, recover M and L based on tag length and nonce length. But this is a lot of mess and requires validating parameters more than you\u0027ve currently done (2 \u003c\u003d L \u003c\u003d 8, M has a whitelist of 7 sizes).\n\nI think it would be better to add EVP_aead_aes_128_ccm_bluetooth and call it a day.",
