      "message": "Hrm. It\u0027s a little bizarre that we take abs(a) before all the BN_mod_word stuff. I think BN_mod_word ignores bn-\u003eneg, but that suggests we should have done BN_abs_is_word. Alternatively, we should maybe stop acting like -7 is a prime number. There are probably few enough callers that we can just check each of them.",
