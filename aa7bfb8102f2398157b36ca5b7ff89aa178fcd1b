      "message": "Hmm, LLVM style rather than Google style? Any reason not to just use the existing top-level `.clang-format`?\n\nAlthough I suspect this didn\u0027t actually do anything because it\u0027s `.clang-format` rather than `.clang_format` and you seem to have applied Google style?\n\nSo I think we can just delete this file. But also since the `IncludeBraces` didn\u0027t take, probably we should do a second pass over the directory with `IncludeBraces` on. (When I did crypto/x509, I did them in two CLs on grounds that `IncludeBraces` maybe warranted some more review. Though TBH I\u0027m not sure what the cases are that might break stuff.)",
