      "message": "While a little subtle, I don\u0027t believe this is out of bounds. Were you able to repr this with ASan/MSan? I notice the CL doesn\u0027t have a test.\n\n`value` is a NUL-terminated C string, which means it is safe to access `value[i]` if you know `value[0..i-1]` are non-NUL. So the `value[0]` access is always okay and, given that\u0027s not NUL, we know the `value[1]` access is okay. Doing it this way also avoids doing two passes over the string if it\u0027s a long one.\n\nIndeed your CL relies on this property too. Under the hood, `strlen` keeps reading bytes until it finds a non-NUL byte.\n\nDoes that make sense, or was I missing something and you had a different issue was something else?",
