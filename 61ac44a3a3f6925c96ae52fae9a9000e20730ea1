      "message": "I see that this is going to be exported in a couple of CLs so I\u0027m going to be awkward here as-if this were already a public API:\n\nThere\u0027s no function to clear an EVP_HPKE_KEY. Sure, it\u0027s a no-op with X25519, but might an EVP_HPKE_KEY have pointers in the future?\n\nWhat\u0027s with setup_base_s? It\u0027s taken from the RFC, but shouldn\u0027t it be \u0027init_sender\u0027 if this is an API for use by people who probably haven\u0027t read the RFC? Likewise \u0027init_receiver\u0027?\n\nI pondered whether there should be separate sender and receiver context types, but probably that\u0027s more extra boilerplate than it\u0027s worth.",
