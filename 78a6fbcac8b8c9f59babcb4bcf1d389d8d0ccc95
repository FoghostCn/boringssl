      "message": "There\u0027s a good chance this\u0027ll eventually neuter the NEON-capable workaround in Chromium someday. Although, looking at the build files, we don\u0027t actually set -mfpu\u003dneon when arm_neon\u003d1. This might be an oversight though.\n\nhttps://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id\u003d448055\n\n(I think this is fine. It\u0027s sort of weird that none of our other code ran into problems with that CPU, but I think if Chromium ever decides to build with -mfpu\u003dneon, we should take as corollary that we no longer care about that broken CPU.)",

      "message": "The Chromium code for that bad CPU only clears |CRYPTO_is_NEON_functional|, which is different and was only ever tested in the poly1305 code. So I think that even if we set -mfpu\u003dneon for that CPU, things will still work as expected. (It was only the poly1305 that seemed to have a problem on that CPU.)",
