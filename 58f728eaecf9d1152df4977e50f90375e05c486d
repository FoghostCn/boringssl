      "message": "We have to build with multiple buildsystems beyond just the CMake one here. I think it\u0027s best to keep the pragmas in here, especially now that we have them, since we may break downstream builds.\n\n(I don\u0027t mind adding ws2_32 to the build though. That aligns with what we did here. https://boringssl-review.googlesource.com/c/boringssl/+/42105 )",

      "message": "BoringSSL is used in far more than just Android, and those downstreams may be satisfied with their current level of toolchain support. Not every project aims to support every toolchain. Moreover, as these kinds of pragmas are relatively common in the Windows ecosystem, it is reasonable to expect your Windows toolchain to work with them.",
