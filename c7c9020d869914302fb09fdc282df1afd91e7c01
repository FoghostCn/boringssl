      "message": "Dunno if it\u0027s worth keeping the funny formatting or not. It\u0027s a bit of a nuisance when updating things. The test normally just gives something we can copy-and-paste and clang-format. I was more thinking this would be more a trip-wire for unexpected changes than anything we\u0027d try to parse out all the time.",
