We\u0027ll eventually end up doing this, but BoringSSL doesn\u0027t have an `SSL_OP_NO_DTLSv1_3` constant yet, and our DTLS 1.3 implementation is still a work in progress.\n\nUntil it\u0027s enabled by default, I don\u0027t think `-no-tls13` is needed here and actually loses a bit of test fidelity. I think we don\u0027t want to do this until slightly later.",
