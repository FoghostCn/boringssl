(Also there\u0027s been recent changes to these files, and it\u0027ll probably be useful later for iOS.)\nI don\u0027t have easy access to a configuration to test this on right now (working from home today) and we don\u0027t have bots yet, so you\u0027ll probably want to verify this doesn\u0027t break.
