      "message": "I\u0027m actually a little confused how this is working. It\u0027s possible it works in one iteration, but not two?? (I should fix the tests to always require two iterations...) If the TLS 1.3 side returns ssl_hs_error, it\u0027s supposed to be sticky and a fatal error.\n\nInstead, the TLS 1.3 bits shouldn\u0027t be messing with rwstate. There should be an ssl_hs_wait_t enum for Channel ID. At some point the old state machine will be rewritten to look like the new one and we\u0027ll have this enum throughout the stack.\n\nI would suggest carving things up at slightly different pieces, especially since we want to change what\u0027s signed anyway.",
