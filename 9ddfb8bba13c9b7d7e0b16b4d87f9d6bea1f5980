But if we do that, probably all the CBS variants want to be T**. Though it\u0027s less scary than the upstream T** because\n\n- We update pointer/length in tandem. Upstream\u0027s T** isn\u0027t actually chainable.\n- We can say that T_free(*out); *out \u003d ret is explicitly a legal thing for these methods to do. And so it\u0027s akin to doing:\n\n  bool BN_parse_asn1_unsigned(CBS *cbs, ScopedBIGNUM *out);\n\nDo you have a preference?\n\nContext: https://boringssl-review.googlesource.com/#/c/5273/2/crypto/rsa/rsa_asn1.c@71",

Given that BIGNUM is fairly consistently value-typed and can be stack-allocated, it makes sense that this function would also take a BIGNUM*.\n\nBN_cbs2unsigned is a very strange name, but it does match BN_bn2bin and friends.\n\nDone. I\u0027ve left the higher-level ones the same for now. Dunno what convention you\u0027d prefer there. Types like RSA* are sufficiently complicated that an RSA* output parameter might be a bit of a nuisance. Still, the current one is kinda verbose.",
