That he sometimes uses 0x66,0x2e and sometimes 0x2e is a little bit confusing.\n\nIntel manual 2.1.1 says 2e is:\n\n  2EHâ€”Branch not taken (used only with Jcc instructions)\n\n66 is apparently:\n\n  Operand-size override prefix is encoded using 66H (66H is also used as a mandatory prefix for some\ninstructions).\n\n\"\"\"\nThe operand-size override prefix allows a program to switch between 16- and 32-bit operand sizes. Either size can\nbe the default; use of the prefix selects the non-default size.\n\nSome SSE2/SSE3/SSSE3/SSE4 instructions and instructions using a three-byte sequence of primary opcode bytes\nmay use 66H as a mandatory prefix to express distinct functionality.\n\nOther use of the 66H prefix is reserved; such use may cause unpredictable behavior\n\"\"\"\n\nI\u0027m not sure how I feel about that being set manually. It seems a little iffy.",
