      "message": "Right now anything that goes in SNI implicitly runs through whatever the caller believes is valid for a DNS name. E.g. in a browser, it needs to successfully transit our URL parser and DNS stack. The public name goes straight from DNS response to the ClientHello. The application doesn\u0027t see it until we get to certificate verification. So this is a new capability, but whether it matters is another question...\n\nAt minimum, ECH needs to have opinions that the public_name is a DNS string and not some random other SAN type, since it ultimately directs the string into certificate verification. (Although it could say that while disavowing syntax checking.) Beyond that, occasionally people get very excited about being able to trick a local memcached into thinking some newline in the ClientHello is a command. I think that problem needs a more robust solution (e.g. a range of TCP ports the browser promises to stay away from), but checking syntax does avert some of that noise.\n\nUnfortunately, once you go down that rabbithole, the IP address thing comes up, and that\u0027s just a mess. :-(",

(I guess we only accept them from validated connections though.)\n\nI think the argument that I can buy is that public names won\u0027t be validated in the normal course of things but matter when you need to switch off ECH, which is probably a bad day for you already. When doing so you don\u0027t want to find that your public name was set to \"???\\n\" or something and you never noticed because it never mattered before.\n\nSo I can see an argument for wanting to guide the ecosystem a little. But the full IP-address parsing is quite a lot? On the other hand, I do bang on about the importance of major implementations being strict in order to guide the ecosystem.",
