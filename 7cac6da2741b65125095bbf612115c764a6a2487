It\u0027s too old.\n\nThis thread suggests that __ANDROID__ is preferred over ANDROID, which is consistent here. ANDROID seems to have unclear meaning and, even in AOSP, apparently means \"building something Android-related\" rather than \"building for Android\".\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/android-ndk/cf9_f1SLXls",
