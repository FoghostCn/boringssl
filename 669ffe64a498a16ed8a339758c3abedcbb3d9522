I wouldn\u0027t expect to see different results from `constant_time_XXX(x, y)` and constant_time_XXX(x, value_barrier_w(y))` to have any difference otherwise.\n\nOr else, perhaps the `value_barrier_w()` really should be applied within the computation of block_start? I.e. maybe the value_barrier_w isn\u0027t in the best place.",
