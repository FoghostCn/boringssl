We change ours so aggressively, it\u0027s easy to tell when we do what.\n\n(I\u0027d actually be pretty happy saying that supported_versions means you can\u0027t go below 1.2 at either client or server. And I don\u0027t mind sending a marginally smaller ClientHello. Although we probably should get the spec to decide on it one way or another and make client/server agree.)",
