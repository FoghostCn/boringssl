      "message": "You say that as if this CL was intended to be an end state. :-P This CL was just to reduce the number of codepaths in advance of reshuffling things further once this branch had cleared.\n\n(HOST_c2l needs to get split into little-endian and big-endian-specific macros. Right now the include guard and ifdefs are both nonsense. And then move this to a different singly-included header leaving HASH_UPDATE, etc., definitions in a now multiply-included one or turn the multiply-included parts into an IMPLEMENT_HASH_FUNCTIONS macro or other mechanism.)",
