      "message": "This paragraph is confusing. I think it reflects a design issue with this CL (A), and a related design issue with draft-ietf-tls-subcerts-02 (B).\n\nThe first sentence sounds like the caller must check the ClientHello before calling this function. In contrast, the second sentence sounds like it\u0027s not the callers responsibility because BoringSSL will internally figure out whether it can use the DC.\n\nI think you actually meant to say that this API does not currently support multiple DCs but, with the spec as currently written, multiple DCs may be needed in general. That leads to the CL\u0027s design issue (A): the SSL_CTX API is basically unusable given DC version/sigalg-pinning.\n\nOne could fix it with a list of DCs, but that runs into the problem SSL_PRIVATE_KEY_METHOD has around extending to multiple keys. I plan to staple either ex_data or an opaque uint64_t for the future built-in certificate selection logic. Maybe, for now, you remove the SSL_CTX API and reword things? Later we can integrate DCs into future built-in certificate selection mechanism.\n\nHowever, that we need a list at all suggests a design issue with the protocol (B) around future-proofing. It is similar to the problem with external PSKs that necessitated draft-wood-tls-external-psk-importer-00: pinning a caller-provisioned thing with TLS-internal negotiated parameter doesn\u0027t really work. (TLS 1.3 external PSKs are basically broken. It is best to treat them as merely a building block for a feature we never finished. draft-wood-tls-external-psk-importer is what we should have done from the start. Now it is a patch over a mistake.)\n\nConsider when TLS 1.4 happens (or, more imminently, https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/Yl1IUMwkNlJmB9wldkRJy9Mr2Do). While larger deployments will expect to control such rollout, TLS libraries consider changing the default maximum version fair game. OpenSSL and I believe GnuTLS both enable TLS 1.3 by default. BoringSSL has not yet, but we hope to this year.\n\nHowever, an application that uses this API today will only know to provision TLS 1.3 keys and it will break when TLS 1.4 is enabled. (Or it will switch to the fallback, but consider a newer future application that can rely on DC support in its client base. The fallback isn\u0027t great either since it\u0027s presumably less desirable (slower?) or what was the point of DCs?)\n\nThus I do not think DCs should be pinned to TLS version. Domain separation between versions can be handled using the version in the context parameter, no? (Pinning DCs to a sigalg is probably fine as that\u0027s more a property of the key than a property of the TLS library. The existence of multiple sigalgs for a single key is limited to RSA at this point. Realistically just sticking with rsa_pss_*_sha256 probably suffices...)\n\nFixing this would also reduce the pressure to configure multiple DCs at once, so (A) may no longer apply at that point.",

I think it reflects a design issue with this CL (A), and a related design issue with draft-ietf-tls-subcerts-02 (B).\n\u003e \n\u003e The first sentence sounds like the caller must check the ClientHello before calling this function. In contrast, the second sentence sounds like it\u0027s not the callers responsibility because BoringSSL will internally figure out whether it can use the DC.\n\nSo that we\u0027re on the same page, what I mean is this: the caller may configure any *one* DC it wishes, but it will only be used in a handshake if the parameters match those authorized by the delegator (i.e., sigalg and version in the DC must match the negotiated values). (See ssl/ssl_cert.cc:853.)\n\n\u003e I think you actually meant to say that this API does not currently support multiple DCs but, with the spec as currently written, multiple DCs may be needed in general. That leads to the CL\u0027s design issue (A): the SSL_CTX API is basically unusable given DC version/sigalg-pinning.\n\u003e\n\u003e One could fix it with a list of DCs, but that runs into the problem SSL_PRIVATE_KEY_METHOD has around extending to multiple keys. I plan to staple either ex_data or an opaque uint64_t for the future built-in certificate selection logic. Maybe, for now, you remove the SSL_CTX API and reword things? Later we can integrate DCs into future built-in certificate selection mechanism.\n\nI think this is a good point; it definitely make sense to remove this API call.\n\nThe idea for SSL_CTX I had originally was to have a callback set the DC on the fly. It could also set the DC signing key or use the dc_key_method. The tricky part that I foresee is that the server\u0027s parameter preferences (version, sigalg) could, in principle, depend on which DCs are available.\n\n\n(B)\n\nI think it\u0027s worth discussing whether version pinning for DCs should be changed or dropped in draft-03, but allow me to explain the rationale as I understand it. DCs are delegated to proxies for terminating TLS on behalf of the delegator; version pinning is intended to prevent a (compromised) proxy from downgrading connections made on its behalf, without the need to update the client. For example, this allows the delegator to prevent the use of DCs with an old draft of 1.3, or with 1.3 itself once we\u0027re in 1.4-world.\n\nWhile version pinning is security conservative, whether it prevents (or will prevent) a concrete attack is debatable. However, I think we can count on someone finding a major flaw in 1.3 someday; this allows delegators to hedge against this eventuality. However, there might be other mechanisms that are better suited.\n\n\u003e However, an application that uses this API today will only know to provision TLS 1.3 keys and it will break when TLS 1.4 is enabled. (Or it will switch to the fallback, but consider a newer future application that can rely on DC support in its client base. The fallback isn\u0027t great either since it\u0027s presumably less desirable (slower?) or what was the point of DCs?)\n\nThis is an important point. One thing we might do enforce a minimum version (e.g., \u003e\u003d1.4) for a DC rather than a particular version (e.g. 1.4).",
