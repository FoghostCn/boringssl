      "message": "I\u0027m not thrilled with there being 2x the number of functions for each structure. The motivation was partly that the pre-CBB_zero CBB was really tedious. Though it also avoids forgetting the CBB_len check (and crypto/err consistency). I dunno. Thoughts? I\u0027m not super-attached to these and could do away with them too.",
