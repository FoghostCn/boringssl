This seems to put the wrong value in the transcript.\n\nNow that I look at it again, I think I see where this strategy got tripped up. This CL is making two finishedHashes, but purely for managing the confirmation value. Instead, think of this as doing two handshakes in parallel and figure out which one to proceed with. That is:\n\n- Have two finishedHash objects as before, but one is for the outer handshake and one is for the inner handshake.\n\n- Now that we know exactly which messages go into which, just write the right ones immediately rather than deferring.\n\n- hs.finishedHash is, say, the outer one and hs.innerFinishedHash is the ClientHelloInner one or so.\n\n- Now there are no parameters to doTLS13Handshake()\n\n- Bring back deriveSecretPeek() so we can compute both the confirmation value and the actual handshake secret with the same finishedHash.\n\n- Once we\u0027ve figured out which handshake we\u0027re running, we can swap out hs.finishedHash for hs.innnerFinishedHash as needed and continue as before.\n\nThat should hopefully be clearer and align better with what\u0027s actually going on. In particular, when we fix the HRR issue, we need to test inner and outer ClientHellos with different cipher suite and key share preferences. But, in order to test that, we need to be able to clearly manage which state corresponds to which connection. The current strategy cannot handle that cleanly.",
