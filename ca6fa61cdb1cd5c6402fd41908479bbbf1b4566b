      "message": "I think we should consider removing these. And also the newly added \"to_time_t\" - we literally just added this because our \"feature\" said we neeeded it - but in fact we fixed the consumers with \"to_posix\" so IMO we should just provide \"to_posix\" and people can do their own overflow detection and convert once they have an int64_t. version of time.  I know that sounds scary, but I believe people will screw that up less than they will screw up checking for an error condition in an OpenSSL style API. \n\nHowever, I was planning on doing that in a followon.",
