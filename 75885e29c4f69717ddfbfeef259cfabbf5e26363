      "message": "That looks like, for whatever reason, the gas that configuration is using doesn\u0027t know about ADX instructions. (Hrm. I don\u0027t think my desktop has those instructions. That would explain why bssl speed was a wash. Note to self: pay attention to what hardware you\u0027re testing on. :-) ) The version check thinks it needs binutils 2.23. Trusty has 2.24, so I\u0027m guessing whatever you\u0027re running on is too old. (Are you on Precise?)\n\nIf needed, I suppose we can manually encode that instructions. I don\u0027t know what kinds of build targets we end up needing to support right now.",
