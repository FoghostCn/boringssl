(Hopefully we\u0027ll never need to... if we do, I think this BER -\u003e DER approach doesn\u0027t work anymore? I think those two are otherwise ambiguous.)\n\nI think the other potential failure mode is that we won\u0027t get the constructed bit right if we see\n\n  [0] IMPLICIT \u003cprimitive type\u003e\n\nencoded as an empty indefinite-length TLV. We can\u0027t distinguish between that and an empty\n\n  [0] IMPLICIT SEQUENCE OF \u003cwhatever\u003e\n\n(Both of which seem fine to me. As long as it imports the only thing we actually care about, whatever.)",
