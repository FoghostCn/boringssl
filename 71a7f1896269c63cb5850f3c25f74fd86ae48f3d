      "message": "Hmmm. If this were only used within Chromium, I think I\u0027d say exposing the internals is fine. But presumably we\u0027ll eventually need to make Chromium use a public API. So I\u0027d slightly lean towards making a new vector even though it makes me a little sad.\n\n(For completeness, one way to both have no copies but also not worry about API surface is for Chromium to own the storage and implement a custom CertIssuerSourceStatic. That is probably far more trouble than is worth it though.)",
