Is that correct?\n\nCorrect. I interpreted the current comment about `nanolibc` meaning the same thing:\n\n\u003e nanolibc\n// sometimes build for a non-Linux target (which should not define __linux__),\n// but also sometimes build for Linux. Although technically running in Linux\n// userspace, this lacks all the libc APIs we\u0027d normally expect on Linux, so we\n// treat it as a non-Linux target.\n\nversus the `__TRUSTY__` and `ANDROID_BAREMETAL` which are doing the wrong thing and should be fixed:\n\n\u003e // Trusty and Android baremetal aren\u0027t Linux but currently define __linux__.\n// As a workaround, we exclude them here.",
