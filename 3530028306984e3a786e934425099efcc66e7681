      "message": "Thanks for the feedback!\n\n\u003e The CL description says it only enables the new ciphers by name, but that\u0027s not actually true. (You forgot to mark them deprecated.)\n\nAh, I see. I need to add them to `ssl_cipher_is_deprecated()`, not just `kLegacyCiphers` (done).\n\nOut of curiosity: it\u0027s surprising to me that a cipher such as `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256` is deprecated, whereas `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA` is not. Aren\u0027t the SHA256 variants strictly better?\n\n\u003e Also SSL_HANDSHAKE_MAC_DEFAULT should be SSL_HANDSHAKE_MAC_SHA256. Only matters for TLS 1.0 and 1.1, where this cipher doesn\u0027t work, but that mistake was why you had to adjust the min_version function.\n\nFixed, thanks!",
