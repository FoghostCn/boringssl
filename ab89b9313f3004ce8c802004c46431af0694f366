      "message": "Ugh, that\u0027s a good point. Looking through callers, SSLv3_method and friends are all callers that explicitly asked for SSL 3.0, usually because they have some configuration file or are (sigh) a bindings library.\n\nI\u0027m thinking the sanest option here is to keep SSLv3_method \"working\" in so far as SSL_CTX_new and SSL_new will work (since no one checks those) but the handshake will fail. I believe this is what Conscrypt ultimately did too. What do you think?",
