Every one of them will complicate things.\n\nSo.. I\u0027m gonna ask you to follow on and get rid of this in your tests. If you want to Base64 or Hex things boringssl actually has things you can call into for this if you don\u0027t want to just write the utilities here in rust.",

The std library is missing core functionality that even defers to external crates in documentation, so my concern is that it will one day be unavoidable",
