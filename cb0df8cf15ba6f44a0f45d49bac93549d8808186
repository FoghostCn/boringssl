      "message": "Let\u0027s just break this SSL 3.0 special case. It\u0027s obnoxious and one of the few places where ssl-\u003eversion is read before version negotation. It occurs to me it doesn\u0027t affect SSL 3.0 consumers (which should hopefully be nearly gone) but *maximum* SSL 3.0 consumers. This would only matter if there\u0027s a *maximum* SSL 3.0 consumer hiding somewhere (I have a CL which should help flush them out) AND it talks to an SSL-3.0-only server AND that server is TLS-1.0-intolerant.\n\nSo we can do:\n\nuint16_t wire_version \u003d TLS1_VERSION;\nif (ssl-\u003es3-\u003eaead_write_ctx !\u003d NULL \u0026\u0026\n    ssl-\u003es3-\u003eaead_write_ctx-\u003eversion \u003c TLS1_3_VERSION) {\n  wire_version \u003d TLS1_3_VERSION;\n}\n\nYou\u0027ll probably need to fix up a few tests to do it, but ah well.",
