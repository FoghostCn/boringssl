      "message": "Setting the value to zero actually didn\u0027t quite work right before the recent changes anyway. A zero timeout, if round-tripped through serialization would magically turn into a 3 second timeout. It was really bizarre. But, yeah, zero should mean sensible things now.\n\nIf you just need this for zero, though, you can just set SSL_MODE_NO_SESSION_CREATION at an appropriate point.",

Then you don\u0027t have this really nasty discontinuity at SSL_DEFAULT_SESSION_TIMEOUT. See comment in C files for implementation.",

      "message": "Putting this on the SSL_HANDSHAKE is bizarre. It means this function cannot be called until the handshake has started, which is not how most configuration APIs work. It also no longer interacts with SSL_clear the same way as everything else.\n\nThe usual pattern is to put it on the SSL. Then, in SSL_new, you copy the value from the SSL_CTX. When you use the value, you just read from the SSL and ignore the SSL_CTX altogether.",
