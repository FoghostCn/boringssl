We\u0027d just have another platform where we need to go define BN_UMULT_LOHI. If BN_UMULT_LOHI is missing, the compile error should be pretty straight-forward.",

I think a reasonable interpretation of the current state is that there\u0027s a codepath for BN_ULLONG and a codepath for BN_UMULT_LOHI and one of these must be defined.
