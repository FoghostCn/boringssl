      "message": "(Sorry, missed this the first time around.) Testing the boundary condition seems prudent. I.e. maybe making the buffer exactly 1 too short (so `test.expected_result` bytes long), either by just sizing the array larger and passing in `test.expected_result` or making a `std::vector\u003cchar\u003e` of exactly the size we want.",
