      "message": "Skipping early data just means skipping over undecryptable[*] records after the ClientHello. If you do it more than you should, there won\u0027t be any interop problems. It\u0027s just less strict than it ought to be.\n\n[*] Well, for HRR \"undecryptable\" is a little goofy because the expected record is cleartext. But we do a trial \"decryption\" by checking the outer content type.",
