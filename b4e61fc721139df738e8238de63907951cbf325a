      "message": "It was just to get this function back to aligning with upstream, since it didn\u0027t cost anything. Before, it couldn\u0027t since there was an extra parameter.\n\n(Probably not worth bothering. I just remember there being minor turbulence around this function before, so I figured it was cheap enough to avoid turbulence from third_party imports going forward, in case someone else is using ERR_LIB_USER or whatever. Happy to also just drop the pointless parameter.)",
