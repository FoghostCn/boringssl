      "message": "Android has a fixed config.h for ipsec-tools that doesn\u0027t set HAVE_STRLCAT. Over time, bionic grew support for strlcat but the config.h wasn\u0027t updated.\n\nWithout HAVE_STRLCAT defined, ipsec-tools #defines it to something. In general, that should still be fine but strlcat is declared with __attribute__((asm(\"strlcat\"))) and the sum of all that causes things to go wrong.\n\nThe config.h should be fixed too in Android, but since we don\u0027t need string.h in base.h, this change is also a good idea.",
