      "message": "Oh lovely.\n\nI suspect that won\u0027t actually do anything. We don\u0027t usually use `git cl upload` when working on BoringSSL, just pushing to `refs/for/whatever` directly. (`git cl upload`\u0027s CL-per-branch workflow makes chained CLs rather tedious.)\n\nBots getting confused is a bit irksome though. We could get in the habit of writing `boringssl:516` instead, though it\u0027s more typing. I don\u0027t suppose we can fix those bots? bugdroid itself seems to generally believe in per-repo defaults, so it seems weird to just workaround some other component interpreting it incorrectly. :-/",
