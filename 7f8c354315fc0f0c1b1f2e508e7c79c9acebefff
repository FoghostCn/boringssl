      "message": "Selecting candidates independently from each other was intentional, between matching the rules in FIPS 186-4, and also to avoid timing side channels. Our constant-time implementation relies on the fact that rejected composites are uncorrelated with the final secret prime. Incrementing old composites breaks this.\n\nUltimately, RSA key generation is not a fast operation and if your system relies on fast RSA keygen, you\u0027re probably doing something wrong.\n\nPS: This doesn\u0027t seem to be any faster on my machine anyway.",
