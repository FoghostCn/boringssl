Let\u0027s leave this in here I guess and we\u0027ll just land it without any enforcement. But you will likely have to tell us if it regresses again.\n\nSorry about the churn. :-(",

If it\u0027s really easy, sure, but don\u0027t waste too much time on it if you don\u0027t want to. I\u0027m fine doing this without the warning.",
