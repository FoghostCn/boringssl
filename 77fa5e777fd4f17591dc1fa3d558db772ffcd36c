      "message": "It seems brittle to me that this code would only work for built-in curves that don\u0027t need the group to be freed. Maybe it is worth keeping the `EC_GROUP_free` in case the code is changed later to work for arbitrary curves because some third-party thing requires it to support some weird curve (probably P-192)?",
