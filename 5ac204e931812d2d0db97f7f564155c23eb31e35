      "message": "This framework doesn\u0027t currently have a way to say experimental_hdrs vs. regular hdrs. We could add that, but I was just trying to match generate_build_files.py\u0027s feature set for now. (The idea is this stuff will translate 1:1 with generate_build_files.py output.)\n\nI.e. this is the crypto_headers vs crypto_experimental_headers tradeoff we were talking about. I think, between the ifdef and the manual work needed to do the target split, I think defaulting to putting them together is a fine tradeoff.",
