      "message": "This is intentional. Ticket renewal in TLS 1.3 is implicit, and it is useless in TLS 1.2. As a server, one cannot safely deploy it because older SChannels will break. As a client, it must not extend the short session lifetime because the key does not change. (BoringSSL clamps the lifetime of a renewed ticket to the original session. I certainly hope other clients do the same.)",
