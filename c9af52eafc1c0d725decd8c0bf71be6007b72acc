      "message": "Code coverage says these two are also not currently tested... but they\u0027re not dead codepaths because there are TLS-1.2-only CBC mode cipher suites that use SHA-256 and SHA-384 HMACs.\n\nMaking runner.go support them would be pretty easy, but I wonder if we should just remove them. Do we care about them on the server? On the client, Chrome is already filtering those out. Since they\u0027re 1.2-only, one would hope that you\u0027re negotiating AES_GCM or CHACHA20 with 1.2. Then again, there is IE11\u0027s silly thing of only doing AES_GCM with ECDHE_ECDSA... so if we\u0027re not using an RSA certificate, having AES_128_CBC_SHA256 is probably somewhat better than AES_128_CBC_SHA...",
