      "message": "This feels mildly weird because orig_len was sampled from out, but it does work since it\u0027s the global length. Ditto with line 2272.\n\nThese we could replace with a CBB_child_len. But it doesn\u0027t replace the one at line 2255 without length-prefix-less scope-only child CBB and at some point it\u0027s not clear that machinery is better than a slightly confusing CBB_len.\n\n(The one invariant I\u0027d like to preserve is that, if you\u0027re passed a CBB *out, your behavior doesn\u0027t vary whether |out| is fixed vs allocating, and no matter how much was written to |out| already. Using CBB_len takes some care to ensure this.)",
