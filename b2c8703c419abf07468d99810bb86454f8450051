Something about how you should write some data to the pointer, but once you\u0027ve set it up, throw away the pointer and treat it as immutable.",

Historically MSVC took a lot of offense at stuffing function pointers into void* because C doesn\u0027t promise they fit on all implementations. Apparently we\u0027re not all that confident about this von Neumann architecture idea yet.\n\nAmusingly GCC didn\u0027t care, and GCC is far more likely to run on platforms where they were different sizes.",
