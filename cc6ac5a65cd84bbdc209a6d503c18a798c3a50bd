Main reason I could think of caring is that BORINGSSL_self_test() is exposed as public API, so it\u0027s not guaranteed that we\u0027ll abort as soon as it fails.\n\nFreeing in the error path is mildly annoying because of how the setters take ownership. If we want to do that, might be worth pulling it into a function similar to self_test_rsa_key().",
