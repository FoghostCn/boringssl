      "message": "I don\u0027t particularly mind after way, but what\u0027s the motivation for moving this inside the library instead of inside the Rust crate? For the moment, it seems this is exclusively a Rust limitiation. E.g. Python CFFI is perfectly capable of binding the function. And it seems there\u0027s some progress towards the Rust limitation getting addressed in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen/pull/2335\n\n(This is a macro, not an inline function, but it\u0027s the same fundamental primitive. We might even be able to just make this an inline function rather than a macro.)",

      "message": "My motivation is to reduce the reliance on `build.rs`, because its disruptive to a lot of the paths to make rust-openssl\u0027s BoringSSL support more transparent (wall of text available at https://github.com/sfackler/rust-openssl/issues/1768#issuecomment-1365402267)\n\nIf you think it\u0027s a better direction to make these inline functions, and then chase down the bindgen angle, I\u0027m happy to do a different CL that converts the macros to inline functions (which I think OpenSSL3 also did) and then we can wait for a bindgen release with that functionality to remove the build.rs stuff. Let me know if that\u0027s your preference.",
