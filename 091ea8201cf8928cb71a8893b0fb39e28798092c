For the moment, it seems this is exclusively a Rust limitiation. E.g. Python CFFI is perfectly capable of binding the function. And it seems there\u0027s some progress towards the Rust limitation getting addressed in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen/pull/2335\n\n(This is a macro, not an inline function, but it\u0027s the same fundamental primitive. We might even be able to just make this an inline function rather than a macro.)",
