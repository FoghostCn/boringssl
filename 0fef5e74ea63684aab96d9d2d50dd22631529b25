That means that ssl-\u003esession (the ClientHelloInner\u0027s session) is TLS 1.3 and up, so the SSL_R_OLD_SESSION_VERSION_NOT_RETURNED will always fail.\n\nI changed this so all the related checks were closer together, but then I added this condition anyway because SSL_R_SERVER_ECHOED_INVALID_SESSION_ID is a bit more accurate for this situation than SSL_R_OLD_SESSION_VERSION_NOT_RETURNED.",
