      "message": "Oh, it\u0027s just because it doesn\u0027t work for comparing `int`s in general because you might overflow or underflow. It\u0027s fine if you know the `int` is non-negative, because `0 - INT_MAX \u003e\u003d INT_MIN`, but I\u0027d taught myself to write out the long form as a result. :-)\n\nWhat happened was I originally wrote this not realizing that it\u0027s okay for non-negative values and then figured, eh, the dedup is still useful and I may as well keep it at the more straightforward version.",
