      "message": "It\u0027s in Microsoft headers, as usual. :-/ \nhttps://luci-logdog.appspot.com/v/?s\u003dboringssl%2Fbuildbucket%2Fcr-buildbucket.appspot.com%2F8977971719457182672%2F%2B%2Fsteps%2Fninja%2F0%2Fstdout\n\nIt looks like it\u0027s part of their iostream implementation which assembles a printf format string corresponding to std::ios_base::fmtflags. It\u0027s one of those warnings that\u0027s not on by default but since we pass /Wall to MSVC, it gets turned on. The problem is Microsoft interprets /Wall to mean actually all (clang/gcc\u0027s -Weverything), rather than /Wsensible. In particular, Microsoft does not promise that their headers pass their /Wall, only /W4. That\u0027s why we keep hitting this mess of suppressions. (I do wonder if /W4 combined with manually re-enabling additional warnings we think are plausible is a better tactic. /W4 is what Microsoft actually recommends.)\n\nWe do have coverage of this warning in clang by way of -Wformat-literal, so I\u0027m not too torn up by losing it here. Chromium also builds with clang on Windows in on the CQ, so we\u0027ll even cover it in Windows-only code.",
