      "message": "I really don\u0027t understand the need to remove ppc64 assembly. The community still maintains it and it\u0027s being used in Chromium ppc64le. Firefox stance on ppc64le is accepting external contributions but not guaranteeing it won\u0027t break and from time to time it gets fixed after the release. Google, on the other end, plainly refuses to mainline any kind of patches. So much for a company who\u0027s motto used to be \"don\u0027t be evil\".",

      "message": "We don\u0027t have access to ppc64le machines nor do we have ppc64le builders in our CI any longer. We can\u0027t do a good job of maintaining dedicated assembly for ppc64le now, hand-crafted assembly is obviously very expensive code to carry, and we won\u0027t ship anything that we can\u0027t stand behind. ppc64le still works using generic code and, if you want to carry the assembly in a local patch you can, of course, do so.",

We get carried along with wider decisions across Google and ppc64le is no longer a top-tier platform that Google supports. I know this pattern differs from more community driven open-source projects, but the first line of our README, from the very beginning, has never hidden this difference: \"BoringSSL is a fork of OpenSSL that is designed to meet Google\u0027s needs.\".",

      "message": "It\u0027s the company who produces the Talos 2 and the Blackbird, the only fully free (down to the firmware) high end workstations available in the market. You might not have heard of them because they offered CI infrastructure mostly on the Chromium groups. They gave up on upstreaming ppc64le support in Chromium long time ago because Google didn\u0027t care to accept any contribution and they\u0027re maintaining external patches since then. Chromium\u0027s engine is at the core of the web, including things like electron applications which constitutes a big part of cross platform applications and Google\u0027s irresponsibility is deeply damaging the whole ecosystem, especially considering there are no other fully free platforms available. BoringSSL is just a small part of the picture, but Google\u0027s attitude remains the same across the whole board.\nAgain, please don\u0027t hide behind the \"we lack the hardware\"/\"external resources don\u0027t suffice\" excuse: I\u0027m sure Raptor CS would be more than happy to donate one of their servers if that means getting Google aboard. Let me know if I need to get you in contact with them.",
