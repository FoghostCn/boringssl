      "message": "The zero case is actually impossible, but ah well. (We only ever invert y of the point we are multiplying. If y \u003d 0, then P \u003d -P and P + P \u003d inf. That means P has order 2, which is impossible in prime-order curves, or P is infinity. We never multiply infinity by anything because that\u0027s not a legal peer point.)",
