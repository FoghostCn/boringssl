      "message": "Sort of a puzzling set of casts. 176 does an overflow check for int. Then the first blen+inl adds as ints and casts to size_t. And then we cast blen to size_t and add it to an int to compare to a size_t.\n\nGiven that b-\u003elength itself is a size_t and everything, maybe blen should be size_t and inl should get converted to size_t early and we forget about INT_MAX. I think the only thing that cares is BIO_get_mem_data, but it was already sad. I guess it can do an INT_MAX check at that point.",
