      "message": "This comment is kinda weird. I guess because they have both new/free and init/cleanup, but init is required even if you use new, someone might do new + init + cleanup + free. Also their ecdaa1aefd30a3624624a28139a1e78e17993725 makes init call cleanup on failure which, with all the callbacks, I think is wrong.\n\n*shrug*",
