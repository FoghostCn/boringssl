(If we want to use a limit, we\u0027d need to do something like limit the number of KeyUpdates we receive before we get a chance to clear ours. But even that won\u0027t work because the limit will have to be 1 for us to consider that MUST acceptable to follow.)\n\nRather this is about having a bound on how much data we will process without returning application data. (Really it\u0027s a problem with NewSessionTicket and any post-handshake message at all. But I think we care about this more on the server.)",
