      "message": "The (original) code mixes hexadecimal and decimal offsets and it took me a minute to realize that while wondering why %r15 is not colliding with %xmm15. It would nice to convert everything to hex (copy from here: https://paste.googleplex.com/5784065864105984)\n\nIf we convert everything to hex, it becomes clear that on Windows there is a small gap between the xmm register locations and the r* register locations. Offsets -0x30 to -0x38 are unused. I can\u0027t see a reason why the gap exists. Should we close the gap? It doesn\u0027t make a big difference, and only very minimally reduces stack pressure.\n\nFeel free to ignore this as it\u0027s really minor.",
