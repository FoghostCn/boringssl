The command line would need -march\u003daarch64 and at least \n-mcpu\u003dcortext-a53 for an aarch64 ASM file.\n\nThe file is not included in the aarch64 input files in boringssl.gypi in the Chromium build, but it is included in the Dart gyp build because all files for all architectures must be included in each target there, so the guards must be correct.",
