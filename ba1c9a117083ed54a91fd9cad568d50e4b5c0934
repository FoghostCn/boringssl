      "message": "It looks like the way Chromium does it, NaCl is an operating system while PNaCl is an architecture. And so we\u0027d keep OPENSSL_PNACL here and set an OPENSSL_NACL down with the OS\u0027s.\n\nArguably you want OPENSSL_64_BIT to be set for 64-bit NaCl anyway. That controls whether BIGNUMs are implemented with uint64_t or uint32_t and uint64_t operations are still legal in x86_64 NaCl I believe. It\u0027s just pointers are 32-bit. (Hopefully we don\u0027t have any code which assumes the pointer size is the same as the bittedness?)",
