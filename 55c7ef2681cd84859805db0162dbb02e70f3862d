It seems -Wno-tautological-constant-compare disables -Wtautological-constant-out-of-range-compare which is I suppose a bit less insane?\n\nThat said, I think I have a bigger problem right now which is that Clang versioning is totally nuts. :-) Apple\u0027s clang claims \"Apple LLVM version 9.0.0\" while our newer trunk clang claims \"clang 6.0.0\". Looks like I need to fiddle with this thing...\n\nhttps://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/policy/CMP0025.html",
