      "message": "Me too. Though I\u0027m not sad to lose these unions. They\u0027re a little absurd.\n\nThough it occurs to me that I could have just casts \u0026nm to (ASN1_VALUE**). I\u0027m not sure if that\u0027s valid C either, but the generated d2i_FOO and i2d_FOO functions thoroughly rely on this anyway. We also may as well generate and call the generated d2i/i2d functions, but we\u0027d need some macros to generate static versions and, more importantly, implicit tagging wouldn\u0027t quite work. It\u0027s all a mess.\n\nAnnoyingly, I found just enough folks using asn1t.h _and_ referencing ASN1_ITEMs for X509 types that I suspect we\u0027ll be stuck keeping some level of compat with that mess. :-(",
