      "message": "Maybe. Though this is far from the first API we don\u0027t like. ðŸ˜„\n\nI worry a bit that, since a lot of Google projects like to just `-Werror` (non-error warnings tend to be invisible), we\u0027ll be very limited in how much we can actually do this. E.g. we may \"deprecate\" a function because *we* think it\u0027s bad, but OpenSSL doesn\u0027t, and so we\u0027d just need to support it for compatibility with 3p code indefinitely. But we can play around with options here.",
