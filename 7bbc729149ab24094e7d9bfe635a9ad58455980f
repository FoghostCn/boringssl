We generate some CMake builds in generate_build_files.py that may be more suitable.\n\n(This is a mess and I\u0027m trying to unify things, but in the meantime, that\u0027s probably the right entrypoint for you all. Having yet another novel CMake build will probably make cleaning this up harder.)",
