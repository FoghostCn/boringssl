      "message": "Agreed. I\u0027d like to try to get rid both of that and having multiple slots of CERT_PKEYs for each key type. The latter isn\u0027t in itself an inherently pointless feature, but the early callback (or cert_cb) can do the same thing and take more things into account.\n\nIt\u0027s also unlikely that anything was using it. Apache does expose this, but before 1.0.2 there was no way to configure a separate chain per slot. You either used the auto-chaining feature or you appended extra_chains which is always the same for each slot.",
