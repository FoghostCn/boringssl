      "message": "This seems a little inconsistent about what a \"private key\" is. ED25519_keypair and ED25519_sign believe that a \"private key\" is 64 bytes, since it secretly has a copy of the public key after it, while this function believes that a \"private key\" is 32 bytes.\n\nNot sure what the appropriate abstraction should be. (Adam?) One thought is this could be ED25519_import_raw_private_key or something like that which takes in a [32]byte and spits out a [64]byte. Though then we need even more machinery to go from a [64]byte private key to a [32]byte public key if there\u0027s need for that. Or maybe ED25519_import_raw_private_key should have both uint8_t out_public_key[32] and uint8_t out_private_key[64].\n\n(Also, nit pick: other Ed25519 functions also believe the public key is a \"public key\" but this one believes it is a \"public value\".)",
