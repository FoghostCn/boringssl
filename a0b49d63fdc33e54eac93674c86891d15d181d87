The reason that it is in the `$SZ\u003d\u003d4` condition is because this is special logic that is only needed because of the CPU-feature-based dispatching logic, that only exists currently for SHA-256.\n\n\u003e Should PAuth be disabled but BTI enabled, AARCH64_SIGN_LINK_REGISTER would be defined to BTI \u003e I think line 188 could even be moved right after #ifndef __KERNEL__.\n\nI think that would be a good change. It would make it clearer that the `AARCH64_VALID_CALL_TARGET` is needed because of the dispatching logic.\n\nI am working on a patch that I intend to submit to BoringSSL to move the dispatching logic out of the assembly code, into the C code. Now it is clear that in that patch I need to remove the `AARCH64_VALID_CALL_TARGET`.\n\n\u003e Does this look correct?\n\nThat makes sense to me.
