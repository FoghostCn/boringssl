      "message": "What would a caller do with this information that a single number wouldn\u0027t solve? We\u0027re not really used in contexts where the semver split makes much sense.\n\nSemver lets a project say \"I\u0027m only compatible with 1.x and not 2.x\", but we never actually want to do anything with that signal. Most folks use that information to parallel install a dependency or forcibly break the build, but we don\u0027t actually want either.\n\nSupposing we just do a single number, is there a reason we can\u0027t just use the existing `BORINGSSL_API_VERSION` macro?",
