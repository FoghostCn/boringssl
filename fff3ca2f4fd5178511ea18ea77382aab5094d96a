      "message": "not about the reasoning behind this part. Say for example, a chain with both the leaf and intermediate are expired. I\u0027m not sure why that would want to be handled any differently than a chain where only the leaf or only the intermediate are expired. Are there cases where two of the same error should be handled differently than one?",

      "message": "I was thinking less along the lines of dates expired, and more along the lines of one certificate on the chain was revoked vs more than one, one certificate had an unacceptable sigalg, vs more than one (which might be a different sigalg) etc. \n\nI\u0027m *probably* ok with us saying \"well, it doesn\u0027t matter if it\u0027s all the same error we don\u0027t care but was sort of erring on the side of abundant caution here, figuring it\u0027s far easier to be picky by default (and therefore likely drop these into the generic \"it\u0027s very serious you don\u0027t get specifics\" bucket than treating\nit as one error.",

      "message": "thinking about it a little more, even to the point of \"oh I had an expired cert on the leaf\" - we might not care, but *IF* we ever got to \"I have an expired leaf and an expired intermediate\" the expired intermediate could mean that, were we checking for revocation, the intermediate was revoked but since it is expired we don\u0027t bother checking anymore.  (the same is true of the leaf but let\u0027s assume a world where we don\u0027t do direct expiry checking of leaves). So possibly even in the expired case this still might make sense to just err on the side of caution and say that more than one of the same error is \"multiple errors\" if it happens.",
