      "message": "As I noted elsewhere, now we\u0027re trading one timing leak for another one. It would be good to add a comment noting that we will leak the length of the order at granularity of |BN_BITS2| bits approximately every |BN_BITS2/BN_num_bits(order)|th time. (I guess that leak is already present due to the way |BN_rand_range| works and how it is used above.)",
