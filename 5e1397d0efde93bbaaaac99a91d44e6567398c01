      "message": "Weird that this is only showing up now.\n\nTrusty uses musl these days, right? (b/110161494) Perhaps, rather than having to guard every use of FILE BIOs, we should just make FILE BIOs work? In particular, it\u0027s weird that we simultaneously believe:\n\n* Trusty has FILE from stdio.h\n* Trusty has BIOs in general\n* crypto/bio/file.c only uses functions defined in C, not POSIX (I believe this is true)\n* Trusty somehow doesn\u0027t get to build crypto/bio/file.c\n\nIf you instead just remove the OPENSSL_TRUSTY guard in that file, how far is it from building?",

      "message": "This is actually showing up now because we\u0027ve hijacked Trusty for our firmware build of `boringssl`: http://b/273639386. We don\u0027t have filesystem support enabled in our firmware C library (newlib).\n\nWhat\u0027s interesting is that this *was* compiling fine, but when I tried to add a [change for unrelated compilation flags](https://crrev.com/c/4610318), the build started to fail. I didn\u0027t look into the exact reason the compilation started to fail, since it does look like it\u0027s wrong as written.",
