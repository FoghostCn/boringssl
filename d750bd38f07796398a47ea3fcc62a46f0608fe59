      "message": "Hahahaha. For all its length, I dunno if this actually communicates what we want. It\u0027s not that the *API* is unstable, but the entire primitive may change. I.e. it\u0027s not that you will have to fix it yourself when we remove it, but you will have *no ability to fix it yourself* when we remove it.\n\nPerhaps:\n\n\"This header implements experimental, draft versions of not-yet-standardized primitives. When the standard is complete, these functions will be removed and replaced with the final, incompatible standard version. They are available now for short-lived experiments, but must not be deployed anywhere durable, such as a long-lived key store.\"\n\nNot sure what to name the `#define` because that\u0027s really long. ðŸ˜Š",
