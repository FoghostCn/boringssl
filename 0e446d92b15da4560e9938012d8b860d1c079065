Presumably they might need these annotations too?\n\nCan the change in x86_64-xlate contain some comments about the semantics of this directive and where it\u0027s needed? Is cet.h going to exist in the environments that we care about?\n\nCan Intel SDE test this? In general, how would we notice if we added assembly that wasn\u0027t compliant with this?",
