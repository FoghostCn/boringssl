Is cet.h going to exist in the environments that we care about?\n\nCan Intel SDE test this? In general, how would we notice if we added assembly that wasn\u0027t compliant with this?",

I\u0027ll try to figure out who owns that ACL. In the meantime, you could probably test `all_tests.go` manually with a local SDE install.\n\nRe cet.h, that header doesn\u0027t seem to do much, but it\u0027s probably okay to assume for now that, if your toolchain knows what CET is, it ships the header? (If the C code isn\u0027t built with CET, it doesn\u0027t matter if the assembly is.)\nhttps://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/adcdc9cc3740adba3577b328fa3ba492cbccd3a5/clang/lib/Headers/cet.h\n\nIf we ever run into trouble with it, we can always just encode `endbr64` manually, and then also add the `.note.gnu.property` section ourselves.",
