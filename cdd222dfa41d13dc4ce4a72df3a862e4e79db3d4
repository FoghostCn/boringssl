      "message": "Switched to RSA_decrypt while I was here. Replicating this comment from previous patch set so it\u0027s not lost:\n\nI believe decrypt_len shouldn\u0027t be a secret value at this point, though I can switch this back to the ERR_clear_error() thing and just read uninitialized memory (while masking it off) in the error case. For successful decryption, anything other than rsa_size is a bug. If the decryption failed, we\u0027ve already leaked it based on branching in RSA_decrypt and that\u0027s just malloc failures and stuff.",
