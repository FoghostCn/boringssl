      "message": "Nit: Probably worth a note that this should be called after CRYPTO_set_NEON_capable since those two bits aren\u0027t manipulated independently.\n\n(Or maybe they should be; just have the #else branch\u0027s default be ARMV7_NEON_FUNCTIONAL without ARMV7_NEON. Then if code never touches CRYPTO_set_NEON_functional, CRYPTO_set_NEON_capable will behave as expected and the bits don\u0027t interact weirdly on set.)",
