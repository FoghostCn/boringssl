      "message": "IIRC, we removed that on the theory that, now that the operation is lazy, the entropy draw no longer matters because it\u0027s no longer on binary startup, and you\u0027re going to be drawing entropy for the RSA operation anyway? (In fact, we should probably stop honoring the NO_BLINDING flag and base it purely on where rsa-\u003ee is available. One less knob to worry about testing combinatorially.)\n\nIs the issue that you\u0027re doing a verify instead of a sign, and that verify doesn\u0027t normally draw entropy? If so, Adam, would it work to split the sign and verify self-tests in two so that RSA_sign triggers the sign self-test and RSA_verify triggers the verify one?",

      "message": "Yes, the sign and verify self-tests should be split, It\u0027s not necessary to draw entropy to generate the blinding factor in the verify self-test.\nIn the boringssl_self_test_rsa(), the blinding factor can be fixed to avoid an entropy draw.\nAndroid13 do the boringssl_self_test() from the init stage of OS while the kernel\u0027s pool is not initialized yet on some devices, \nthe action to draw entropy of rsa_sign_no_self_test() is blocked for seconds until the entropy is available.",
