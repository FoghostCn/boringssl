      "message": "Actually, where are you getting 96 from? 96 \u003d 6 * 16, i.e. 6 blocks. But this code seems to process 8 blocks at a time.\n\n(Also a \"block\" is always 16 bytes for AES. This code is doing several blocks at a time.)\n\nI also notice that you\u0027re prefetching an address 3 three iterations in the future (3 * 0x80) and then another address 3.5 iterations. I take it then that prefetcht0 works in 4*16 \u003d 64-byte chunks? Three was chosen because that\u0027s how far ahead of the loop it\u0027s useful to be?",
