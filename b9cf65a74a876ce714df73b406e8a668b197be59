      "message": "Are these official CMake variables for these platforms? That seems odd. The usual way CMake toolchain files are expected to report the system name is with `CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME`.\n\nI see we do use `ANDROID`, but I suspect that\u0027s outdated. That variable comes from the old third-party Android NDK CMake file. In the modern one, it\u0027s only set by android-legacy.toolchain.cmake. I see they still include that file by default, which is probably why our build works at all, but we probably should change that to check `CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME` too...",

      "message": "\u003e Are these official CMake variables for these platforms? \n\nNo, these were just variables that I added, similar to how `ANDROID` was configured. When running `cmake`, I was passing `-DCROS_EC\u003dYES` (or setting the variable in the `CMakeLists.txt` that includes the boringssl cmake files).\n\nWe do have toolchain files for our builds, so it would be easy to set `CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME`, but let me make sure that doesn\u0027t inadvertently cause other issues.",
