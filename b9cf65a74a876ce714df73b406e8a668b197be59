      "message": "Are these official CMake variables for these platforms? That seems odd. The usual way CMake toolchain files are expected to report the system name is with `CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME`.\n\nI see we do use `ANDROID`, but I suspect that\u0027s outdated. That variable comes from the old third-party Android NDK CMake file. In the modern one, it\u0027s only set by android-legacy.toolchain.cmake. I see they still include that file by default, which is probably why our build works at all, but we probably should change that to check `CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME` too...",
