      "message": "Our policy is that supported architectures have a Google business reason behind them and that we have builders / hardware to fix any issues.\n\nIn the case of RISC-V, I suspect a request for support is likely to come from within Google sooner rather than later, so this might be inevitable. But do you happen to be working with a Google team that is motivating this change?",

      "message": "I have been submitting a few patches here and there, mainly driven by my work to port Chromium browser for RISC-V. I recently requested an infra support on RISC-V via this bug request: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id\u003d1331190, since most of the components within Chromium src required depot_tools. So that\u0027s pretty much my engagement with the Google team. Do you have any suggestion that I can do which can help to speed up the support from Google on RISC-V?",
