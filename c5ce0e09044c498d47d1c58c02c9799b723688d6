The design idea I am following is that there should be as few branches in the assembly because we don\u0027t have good tools for analyzing the assembly.\n\nChaCha20_ctr32 is never called with an empty input in the current code base but I decided to leave the check for empty input in the new (static) ChaCha20_ctr32 so that the new logic would exactly match the old logic.",
