      "message": "This line of code concerns me. I noticed it because it triggers a VC++ /analyze warning:\n\nwarning C6293: Ill-defined for-loop:  counts down from minimum.\n\nThis is not by itself reason to change the code. But it concerns me that I cannot tell from looking at the code whether it is being clever, or wrong. The reliance on unsigned wrap-around together with the use of two \u0027magic\u0027 numbers leads to this uncertainty.\n\nPossible improvements could include a named constant, use of a signed integer to make the loop condition more straightforward, or a comment to clarify that the countdown to zero is intentional.",
