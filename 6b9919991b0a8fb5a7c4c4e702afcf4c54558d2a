      "message": "Thanks. I do agree that the crypto/internal.h include seems fine since the p256 file includes `crypto/internal.h` already too.\n\nIncluding base.h explicitly only makes sense if it is the first #include as the only reason to include it is to satisfy the rule \"// This file should be the first included by all BoringSSL headers.\" in base.h. But I\u0027m not sure this rule applies to third-party/fiat and also the p256 header doesn\u0027t follow it.",
