      "message": "It\u0027s probably fine for what we\u0027re currently trying to do, but it\u0027s a little screwy. If it breaks `strength_bits`, then adding the cipher and then calling `@STRENGTH` to sort the ciphers won\u0027t work.\n\nAlso if it breaks exclusions then if you specify a bunch of ciphers and then do something like `!RSA`, it won\u0027t work.\n\nHow much that matters is another matter. For 3DES (which is waiting on a resolution to the Envoy bug...), I tried this. It\u0027s a bit more complex, but seemed maybe a better general story? Dunno. Thoughts?\nhttps://boringssl-review.googlesource.com/c/boringssl/+/59425/1/ssl/ssl_cipher.cc\n\nWe could pull those bits out in advance of sorting out 3DES if we want. Or we could just align on this version... mostly I just want this spelling and the 3DES one to match. :-)",
