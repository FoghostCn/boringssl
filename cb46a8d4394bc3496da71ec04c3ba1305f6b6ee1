It\u0027s skipping past `Xi` and `H`.\n\nIn particular, nothing was reading `ctx-\u003eH` anyway, just relying on an offset. It may as well have been `char wasted_space[16]`. :-)\n\n\u003e And the Xip value in old code, past this code, was pointing into the Htable and was just reusing a confusing name?\n\nYeah, the -0x40 is to undo this adjustment. I suppose, whether you believe this was reusing a confusing name or if `Xi+H+Htable` was a single structure called `Xi` for short is a matter of interpretation.",
