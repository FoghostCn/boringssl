      "message": "Huh. I guess this works, but it is arguably violating the API contract a little. DH expects to take ownership of the BIGNUM. We\u0027re relying on BIGNUM being funny and, rather than BN_init/BN_cleanup vs BN_new/BN_free, having a single BN_free that dispatches cleanup vs free based on some bit in the BIGNUM.",

      "message": "Is your concern around the fact that the BIGNUM itself is on the stack, or that it\u0027s pointing to static data? (Or both?)\n\nIn my mind static-data BIGNUMs are a valid form of BIGNUM that should work fine everywhere, although now I look at bn_wexpand I see that it errors out in their case rather than handling them. But I\u0027d be inclined to fix that and try and say that static-data is fine unless you know reasons why that property is unviable.\n\nIn terms of passing statck-allocated BIGNUMs, I guess that\u0027s a little weird. That could be revised.",
