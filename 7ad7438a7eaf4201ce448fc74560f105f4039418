      "message": "Huh. I guess this works, but it is arguably violating the API contract a little. DH expects to take ownership of the BIGNUM. We\u0027re relying on BIGNUM being funny and, rather than BN_init/BN_cleanup vs BN_new/BN_free, having a single BN_free that dispatches cleanup vs free based on some bit in the BIGNUM.",

We also don\u0027t handle freeing ffdhe2048_q if BN_set_word(\u0026ffdhe2048_g) fails, though that gets complicated with DH_set0_pqg taking ownership.",
