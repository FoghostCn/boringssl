(It\u0027s not visible in some of the other files because the default block partially hides it.) I found some instances of it upstream, so it seems to be the OpenSSL style.\n\nAt some point, we should probably just clang-format the remaining directories. With upstream patches 1.1.1-based and us distantly 1.0.2-based, I mostly rewrite them when applying anyway.",
