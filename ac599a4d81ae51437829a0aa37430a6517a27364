      "message": "Hehe. \"Be glad I gave up on the leak in crypto/asn1.\" :-)\n\nThese wrappers are needed because the others are macros, not functions. The leak is that ASN1_item_ex_d2i decodes something into intname. The new line is analogous to line 231. Normally that loop takes care of moving the contents of intname to nm.x-\u003eentries. But if we abort early, the contents are still owned by intname. Hence the pop_free instead of plain free.",
