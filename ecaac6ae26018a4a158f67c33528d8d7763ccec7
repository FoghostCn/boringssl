      "message": "I suppose I should have given reasons for why I chose this one. :-) But if you think an option is better despite those, I\u0027m not attached to PushToStack. It stumbles a little.\n\nPush - Since it\u0027s not a method, it seemed we should say something about it being for stacks and not something else that is push-able, I dunno. E.g. maybe it\u0027s a BIO_push wrapper.\n\nPushStack - It\u0027s shorter than PushToStack! But it sounds like you\u0027re pushing a stack!\n\nPushUnique - I feel like it doesn\u0027t actually solve Push\u0027s problem and the fact that it gets scopers correct is already a consequence of it being a C++ API.\n\nPushToStack - I guess it solves those problems, though it\u0027s weird.\n\nThoughts?",
