      "message": "Oh, strictly speaking, this is not following the HMAC_Final contract. It, by way of EVP_DigestFinal, requires that the buffer contain EVP_MAX_MD_SIZE, not EVP_MD_CTX_size(mctx). But ssl/ actually passes a tighter-sized buffer.\n\nProbably we should actually be updating those contracts to say the buffer must be EVP_MD_CTX_size(mctx) or EVP_MAX_MD_SIZE. I\u0027ve just left it alone for now.",

This was the only instance I found though, so we can also just get a fix into Android; their version doesn\u0027t work for anything other than HMAC anyway, though it doesn\u0027t look like they use it for anything else.",
