      "message": "This particular instance could also be addressed by C++-ing the internals. EVP_MD_CTX or any other stack-allocated type would have the same issue. How about we find a function in libcrypto (preferably one used by ~everything), move it to C++, and see if we can get it through all the consumers?\n\nI\u0027m optimistic we can get C++ at least. C++11 with std::unique_ptr will probably require getting a bit of an STL into Trusty.",
