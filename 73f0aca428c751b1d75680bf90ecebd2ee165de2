Is that expected?\n\n(Do we need this API to work in v2 at all? Another option would be to say you need to use redeem_raw in v2 and redeem in v1. I dunno if that would work for your purposes.)",

The SRR format needs to be vaguely stable, so we can\u0027t get rid of this field, even though its not currently used for anything.",
