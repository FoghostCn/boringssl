      "message": "Is that quite true? /dev/urandom is never used on FIPS Android, but non-FIPS Android still has that fallback. (This test also runs outside FIPS mode.)\n\nThis test output looks a lot like we were expecting getrandom but got /dev/urandom.\nhttps://logs.chromium.org/logs/boringssl/buildbucket/cr-buildbucket/8807470057942124641/+/u/unit_tests/stdout\n\nAs an alternative to simulating getrandom, we could also say that our CI requires getrandom-capable Androids, and we only test the urandom codepath via this thing. I\u0027d have to adjust our CI a bit though. Expecting to have pre-getrandom machines in CI indefinitely is a bit unreasonable anyway.",
