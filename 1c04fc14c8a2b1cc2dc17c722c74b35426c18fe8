      "message": "TLS 1.3 defines the behavior of the server echoing the legacy_session_id separately from compatibility mode - all that compatibility mode does with session IDs is have the client send a fake session ID. The DTLS 1.3 RFC states that compatibility mode is disabled, and then it goes on to say that servers must not echo the legacy_session_id. This is written as normative language, but it is also written in a way that sounds like it is describing what it means to disable compatibility mode. I chose to implement the normative language in RFC 9147, and assume that it overrides the language in RFC 8446 section 4.1.3 which requires the legacy_session_id_echo match the legacy_session_id regardless of compatibility mode.",
