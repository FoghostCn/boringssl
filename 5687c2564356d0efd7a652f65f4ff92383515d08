      "message": "The ECDSA_SIG serialization stuff isn\u0027t currently in the FIPS module. Looks like we don\u0027t have CBS/CBB or any CBS/CBB users in there at all. I think that\u0027s why we previously checked r and s separately.\n\nIf it\u0027s useful, I think I have a patch lying around to make the low-level ECDSA code output a byte string in the fixed-width r/s concatenation format, and then the entirety of ECDSA_SIG was outside.\n\nThe motivation at the time was to just push BIGNUM out to the edges a tad further, but I wasn\u0027t convinced it was worth bothering when none of our APIs actually exposed fixed-width r/s. Might also get mallocs out of ECDSA signing if we made CBB_init_fixed not always malloc.",
