Perhaps something like:\n\n\u003e |state-\u003eprev| may be NULL either if it is the head of the list, or if |state| is freed before it was added to the list at all. Compare against the head of the list to distinguish these cases.\n\nAlternatively, a `state-\u003ein_list` field would be more explicit, though it is redundant with the state that\u0027s already in there. *shrug*",
