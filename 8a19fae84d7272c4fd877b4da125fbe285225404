      "message": "Does Node actually need these? OpenSSL doesn\u0027t even have a GOST implementation. They\u0027re part of some external engine. And per https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/7651#issuecomment-232877200, Node builds OpenSSL with OPENSSL_NO_GOST.\n\nRather than adding these OIDs, I would suggest sending a patch to Node to either remove the references to these OIDs or at least wrap them in OPENSSL_NO_GOST, which we define. This would be useful for Node too, as it would remove some unnecessary code from their shipped binary.",
