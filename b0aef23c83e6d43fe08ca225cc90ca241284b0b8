      "message": "Well, it\u0027s a SEGV, so not a super sensitive issue. But yeah I figure a NULL `ctx` works often enough[*] that we probably should just fill it in. Otherwise you might call it with NULL, notice it works for your input, but not notice it doesn\u0027t work for other inputs.\n\n[*] A lot of stuff ignores `ctx`. A lot of stuff checks for NULL `ctx`, such as `v2i_AUTHORITY_KEYID`. And yet other stuff doesn\u0027t check, such as the `r2i` path in `do_ext_nconf`.",
