      "message": "Fair enough. I probably would have just kept it in all the files to avoid thinking about it. Also normally I think it rude for a function to not accept the empty input. Memory safety and all that.\n\nBut I suppose assembly already has to have different expectations, and removing it + moving it to C allows the compiler to realize the check is unreachable and delete it. Very important optimization. ðŸ˜Š\n\nRemoved. Interesting this check wasn\u0027t done a few instructions earlier, where it wouldn\u0027t need to undo the STMDB.",

So it would be weird to feel good about this one implementation having the check when it would be missing from all the others.\n\nRE: Optimization of course it probably won\u0027t matter. But I guess 32-bit ARM without NEON is where it has the potential to matter the most. ðŸ˜Š",
