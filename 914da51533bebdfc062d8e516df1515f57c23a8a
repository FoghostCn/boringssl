      "message": "Fair enough. I probably would have just kept it in all the files to avoid thinking about it. Also normally I think it rude for a function to not accept the empty input. Memory safety and all that.\n\nBut I suppose assembly already has to have different expectations, and removing it + moving it to C allows the compiler to realize the check is unreachable and delete it. Very important optimization. ðŸ˜Š\n\nRemoved. Interesting this check wasn\u0027t done a few instructions earlier, where it wouldn\u0027t need to undo the STMDB.",
